Unfortunately, it’s unclear when that fix will go live. For now, there are a few things you can do to try and fix the WB Games connection error in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>The easiest reported fix is to simply restart your game. After closing the game and launching it again, many players have been able to successfully connect their accounts. Another easy fix is to double-check your internet connection – if it’s spotty or currently offline, you’ll (obviously) have problems connecting to WB Games.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another trick is to try and connect your accounts while in-game instead of at the main menu. You can do this by heading into the "Settings" menu and selecting "User Interface Options." Here, you’ll find the "WB Games Account" menu. Input your details, and you might get lucky with a successful connection.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hi Frank, thanks for reaching out about the trouble connecting. Our Game Team is currently aware of this issue and it is being investigated. They are not able to reach out directly, but if you need anything else, let us know.</p>— WB Games Support (@WBGamesSupport) <a href=#>February 7, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for what exactly is causing the problem, WB Games hasn’t made that clear. It’s possible that the servers are simply overwhelmed with the massive influx of early-access players, leading to a myriad of connection issues. If that's the case, consider trying again during off-peak hours, as you might have a better chance of getting a solid connection.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If none of the above fixes work, be sure to reach out directly to WB Games and keep an eye on its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official support page</a>. The game is bound to experience a few hiccups at launch, and if you’re an early access player, you might have to be more patient than most.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is a member of the transgender community and in need of support, call the Trans Lifeline at </strong><strong>, the Trevor Project's 24/7/365 Lifeline at 866-4-U-TREVOR (</strong><strong>), or TrevorChat, their online instant messaging option, or TrevorText, a text-based support option.
