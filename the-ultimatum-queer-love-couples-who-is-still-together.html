At the end of the experiment, the original couples decided whether to get married or call it quits.</p><p>Although season 2 of the Netflix show followed the same premise as its predecessor, Queer Love featured an all-LGBTQ+, predominantly female cast. <a href=#><strong>JoAnna Garcia Swisher</strong></a> also stepped in as host, taking over for <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a>, who headed Marry or Move On.</p><p>In a May 2023 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>POPSUGAR</a>, Swisher said that despite all of the show’s drama, the best part of her hosting experience was witnessing the love the couples had for each other.</p><p>“At the heart of it, there’s just <a href=#>so much love</a> between the people that participated in the show, and it was just really amazing to see how vulnerable they were, and how willing they were to go there and experience the task at hand,” she told the outlet.</p><p>One couple from the show, <strong>Sam Mark</strong> and <strong>Aussie Chau</strong>, feel “<a href=#>even more in love</a>” after going through the experience together. “I really am so lucky to be with this person,” Aussie told <a href=# rel=noopener>Tudum</a> in June 2023, noting that Sam was one of the first people that “questioned” Aussie’s gender identity.</p><p>“She allowed that space for me to explore and I’m <a href=#>still exploring</a>. Am I nonbinary? Am I [a] trans man? Am I transmasculine? These are all the things that weren’t in my vocabulary growing up. Having a partner who’s supportive in that journey has allowed me the space to do that,” Aussie explained.</p><p>The couple are<a href=#> taking their time</a> with planning their nuptials with Aussie noting that their relationship is based on “so much more of a commitment than just having a wedding.” The reality TV alum also revealed that<strong> Tiff Der</strong> and <strong>Vanessa Papa</strong> are the only Queer Love alums who can expect an invitation to the wedding.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for <strong>Mildred Woody</strong>, who was Aussie’s temporary partner during the social experiment, the duo are not currently on speaking terms. “There’s still some healing for me to do on my end, and I’m going to get there,” Aussie explained.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see a status update on each couple from The Ultimatum: Queer Love:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ51KWroqWRqcKuedCunJ6qXaG8t7GMnKauqJyawG7Dx6hkoqtdqMGquMtmq6iflam1pr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yamiche-alcindor-husband-wedding-low-profile-html.html><span>←</span><span>Yamiche Alcindor and her husband keep a low-profile after exchanging wedding vows in 2018</span></a>
