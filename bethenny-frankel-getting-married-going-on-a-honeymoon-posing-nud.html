She’s both hitched in real life and even on her TV show.</p><p>This week, her and husband <a href=#>Jason Hoppy</a> jetted off to St. Bart for their honeymoon, which included skinny dipping, anxiety and more. Also, Bethenny posed for a pregnant nude photo shoot. <strong>Take it away, THG Real Housewives correspondent….</strong></p><p>With their fabulous wedding behind them and Shawn getting himself cryogenically frozen so he can get some serious rest, Bethenny and Jason jet off to honeymoon on St. Bart’s.&nbsp; “I’m trying to be the sexy new bride but I’m a disaster,” Bethenny says.&nbsp;</p><p>This statement sets us up for a week filled with immense fun and laughter as well as hormone-induced crying jags and panic attacks, the highs and the lows occurring most likely within two seconds of each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p style=text-align:center><strong></strong></p><p style=text-align:left>Once on the island, they hop into their rental BMW and speed off across the gorgeous landscape.&nbsp; Of course they are renting a BMW – can you imagine these two in a Ford Fiesta?&nbsp; They arrive at the resort where they have a private villa with butler service.&nbsp; Their villa is gorgeous, enormous, and complete with their own huge pool with giant turtles wandering around it, munching contentedly on tropical grasses.</p><p style=text-align:left>As soon as their luggage hits the floor, Bethenny is immediately topless and she and Jason are in the pool.&nbsp; “When those doors opened, honestly, you took my breath away,” Jason tells Bethenny about their wedding day.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>They say many sweet things to each other and what little clothes they were wearing end up in a sodden heap pool-side.&nbsp; Gigantic iguanas look on suspiciously from the bushes. Jason and Bethenny’s entire submerged and naked bodies are blurred out.</p><p style=text-align:left>Next, the two hit the beach.&nbsp; “I really feel like a pig that needs to be roasted on the beach at a luau,” Bethenny tells us.&nbsp; Jason is particularly fond of commenting on Bethenny’s cankles and her “sausage-link” toes and, luckily, she has a good attitude about it all.&nbsp; She tells us repeatedly that she feels fat and gross but really she must be feeling pretty confident because her bathing suit is essentially a bikini and pretty skimpy at that.&nbsp; Plus, she looks amazing.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>Sure she’s pregnant but she’s totally toned.&nbsp; It’s as hot as a seven months pregnant woman can possibly look.&nbsp; Also, she is sporting a big, floppy fluorescent pink hat and she will wear this hat pretty much non-stop throughout the rest of the honeymoon.</p><p style=text-align:left>Arriving back at their suite, they find a large, wet animal poop on the floor.&nbsp; Bethenny dry heaves, runs through the villa, and freaks out.&nbsp; They are sure it’s one of those huge iguanas done snuck into their bungalow and took a dump but their search turns up nothing.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>Then, they wax a happy trail of dark hair that has developed on Bethenny’s belly.</p><p style=text-align:left>Bump hair successfully removed, the newlyweds have breakfast (pink hat in attendance) and discuss a number of things, including:</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>– Where and when should Bethenny use Jason’s last name?<br>– Bethenny asks about baby development, “When do they talk and walk?&nbsp; When does all that happen? Walking first?&nbsp; When does, like, potty training happen?”<br>– When asked if he has babysat before Jason replies, “Like for two hours and I was exhausted.”<br>– “So at the hospital they just send us home with this little baby or what?” wonders Jason.<br>– “You’re gonna let the baby play, right?” asks Jason when Bethenny talks about insisting on staying organized even with mountains of baby crap.&nbsp; “No, the baby’s gonna be the boy in the bubble,” she replies.<p style=text-align:left>Later, Jason goes on his first windsurfing lesson while Bethenny drools over cute little girls playing on the beach, her face shaded by Mr. Pink Hat.&nbsp; She becomes emotional and wipes tears away.&nbsp; “It was happiness and emotion.&nbsp; It was a little bit of fear.&nbsp; I don’t know, it just took me over.”&nbsp; She elaborates to Jason, post-windsurfing, “I left everything to the last minute of my life and now everything’s like all together.&nbsp; And we’re on our honeymoon and we’re having a baby in two months.”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>“Wanna just stay here and I could give windsurfing lessons?” Jason suggests.&nbsp; How sweet is this guy? Can we please clone him?</p><p style=text-align:left>Being a food connoisseur as well as a pregnant woman with major cravings, Bethenny informs Jason that they are going to go on a “food crawl” and that she will be wearing her fave hat.&nbsp; No, just kidding, the hat is an unannounced guest on the food crawl.&nbsp; She is doing a lot of eating, “Just to really increase maximum swelling,” Bethenny explains.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>Bethenny is very adventurous with food for a pregnant woman.&nbsp; She eats oysters, burning hot raw peppers, as well as two full day’s worth of food in one afternoon.&nbsp; She and Jason laugh and have fun – it looks like they are enjoying each other so much.&nbsp; It’s really nice to see them (but mostly Bethenny because she was wigging out so much in previous episodes) relaxed and happy.</p><p style=text-align:left>On their last night in St. Bart’s Jason arranges for a private dinner on a patio in the middle of the pool. “I really didn’t want it to end,” says Bethenny about the honeymoon.&nbsp; But it’s not all rainbows and unicorns.&nbsp; “I feel very puffy and not like myself.&nbsp; I feel very out of sorts,” she admits.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>But then later she gives Jason a lap dance while wearing a rainbow afro wig.&nbsp; So, clearly, she still feels at least a little confident…or maybe the hormones have just made her not care anymore.</p><p style=text-align:left>Back in New York Bethenny visits a few posh baby stores with her friend Chuck.&nbsp; She needs to furnish the nursery pronto.&nbsp; As she drops about $100,000 on furnishings and accessories she also drops a few funny lines, including:<br>– “Can babies wear white after Labor Day?”<br>– “If we don’t get this done today the baby’s sleeping in a cardboard box.”<br>– “It has to be a girl or it’s being returned.&nbsp; I’d be happy if it was a boy.&nbsp; It should just be healthy with ten fingers and ten toes… and a vagina.”</p><p style=text-align:left>Toward the end of the episode, Bethenny goes to visit her therapist.&nbsp; Obviously they’re not showing us the whole session, but what they show us is so lame and seemingly very un-helpful.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>“You seem happy,” the therapist tells her.&nbsp; Wow, what a deep psychological assessment!&nbsp; How much do you get paid per hour because you should double it!&nbsp; This therapist guy kind of creeps me out.&nbsp; He always has this sort of vague smile on his face and his voice is all smooth in a weird way.&nbsp; I wonder how they found him and why he agreed to allow private sessions to be televised.&nbsp; This seems sort of suspicious to me.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>After her nude pregnancy photo shoot, Jason and Bethenny visit the obstetrician.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>“It’s a mush, it’s a blob, and there’s a heartbeat,” Bethenny says about the image of the baby on the ultrasound.&nbsp; “I could be giving birth to a platypus.&nbsp; I have no idea, I don’t care.&nbsp; I just want it to be healthy… and a girl.” Thank goodness we know Bethenny does in fact <a href=#>have a girl</a> or else all of this would come back to bite her in the ass big time when she popped out a boy!&nbsp; Next week we get to see the blessed event.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>I have to say that I am looking forward to it!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2poX2WEcK7ErZ%2Bepp6ueqe%2BwKeinqRdnLK1wMinnmalkae%2FqrHDZp6ooZ6cerC6jJpkoaeemsauu86nZKmno567qHnNrpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quannah-chasinghorse.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Quannah Chasinghorse net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
