Inside the pro dancer's life and what he really thinks of his country singer partner, Lauren Alaina.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even though <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> Season 28 has only had one episode so far, there's been a lot of drama behind the scenes while the cast competes for that Mirror Ball trophy. From <a href=#>Sean Spicer's controversial casting</a> to <a href=#>Christie Brinkley's competition-ending injury</a> to pro <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artem Chigvintsev</a> boycotting the franchise after he got fired, there's been no shortage of headline-making news.&nbsp;</p><p>One steady (and seemingly drama-free) presence on the show is pro dancer Gleb Savchenko. He made his debut on the show in 2013 with his Real Housewives of Beverly Hills partner <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a>. In the subsequent six seasons he's appeared on the cast, he's failed to come in first, but he has a promising current season with his country singer partner Lauren Alaina.</p><p>In addition to being a top-notch pro dancer, Gleb also steals attention on-screen for his dashing good looks, leading many to wonder exactly what his relationship status is. Is Gleb on Dancing With the Stars married? Inside his family life and what he said about Lauren as a dance partner.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Gleb from Dancing With the Stars married?</h2><p>Those who find Gleb to be an undeniable heartthrob might be disappointed to learn that the pro dancer is happily married ‚Äî and he has been for quite some time.&nbsp;</p><p>The Russian choreographer married Elena Samodanova back in 2006, when he was 23 years old. Elena and Gleb have a lot in common, as she's also a professional dancer from Russia. The pair met as dance partners.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Gleb has an advantage when it comes to choreographing his dance routines on Dancing With the Stars. Elena is a judge on the Russian edition of the show, and she helps her husband come up with his dances. The two have managed to strike a balance between their work and professional lives, as Gleb told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> that's how they maintain a successful relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>"At work, [it's] just a business, so I'm very demanding. I ask a lot from her, she asks a lot from me, but when we're at home, we are just happy husband and wife who love each other," he said. "We just enjoy each other's company. That's the secret, I think. And it's been really successful so far."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Elena and Gleb are also the proud parents of two daughters. Their oldest, Olivia, is eight-years-old, and they welcomed their second, a girl named Zlata in 2017. The girls will certainly inherit some dancing skills from their expert parents.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gleb spoke out about his pairing with Lauren Alaina ‚Äì and how he thinks they'll do.</h2><p>Past partners for the dancer have included RHOBH cast member Erika Jayne, Pretty Little Liars alum Sasha Pieterse, singer Jana Kramer, basketball player Arike Ogunbowale, and comedian Nikki Glaser before he was paired with Lauren Alaina.&nbsp;</p><p>Lauren first appeared on American Idol's 10th season before striking up a successful country music career outside of the show. Kellie Pickler, another American Idol alum, won Dancing With the Stars in 2013. Both Kellie and Lauren's first dances on the show were cha-chas, so perhaps the commonalities will serve well for Lauren's potential to win the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>So so happy you are my partner üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è @laurenalaina @dancingabc üíÉüèºüï∫üèª</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Gleb Savchenko</a> (@glebsavchenkoofficial) on Sep 17, 2019 at 2:30pm PDT</p></figure><p>Gleb is thrilled to be dancing with Lauren, and the two received scores of 6, 6, and 7 on their first routine. The dancer said that he had never received a score as high as 7 with a partner before on the first week, and he also praised Lauren as a partner.&nbsp;</p><p>"So happy you are my partner," Gleb wrote on Instagram about the country singer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren dubbed the duo, "Team Tonkyhonk</a>," so it appears like the warm sentiments are mutual.&nbsp;</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs on Mondays at 8 P.M. on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBus8uemWannmKxorrCoqWgZaeewal506GcZquklr%2B0ecyaqauhlZk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nelson-band.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Fame | Nelson (band) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
