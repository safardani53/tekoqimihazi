This blue is the light that got lost. Light at the end blue end of the spectrum does not travel the whole distance from the sun to us. It disperses among the molecules of the air, it scatters in the water. Water is colorless, shallow water appears to be the color of whatever lies underneath it, but deep water is full of this scattered light, the purer the water the deeper the blue. The sky is blue for the same reason, but the blue at the horizon, the blue of the land that seems to be dissolving into the sky, is a deeper, dreamier, melancholy blue, the blue at the farthest reaches of the places where you see for miles, the blue of distance. This light does not touch us, does not travel the whole distance, the light that gets lost, gives us the beauty of the world, so much of which is in the color blue."</p><p>(Besides the "Love on Top" singer, Oscar-nominated actress <strong>Michelle Williams</strong> is also fond of Solnit's work, having recommended it to a reporter during a 2009 <a href=#>Vogue</a> interview.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since the famous tot's birth on January 7, 2012, fans of both award-winning artists have speculated on the symbolism behind "blue," one being that the color holds special place in the hip-hop icon's heart ("My favorite hue is Jay-Z blue," he rapped in the song "Go Crazy" with <strong>Young Jeezy</strong>), plus he has gone on to release three Blueprint albums in the last decade.</p><p>"Ivy," meanwhile, reportedly references the Roman numeral ("IV") for 4 — a significant digit for both Beyonce and Jay-Z: Beyonce's birthday is Sept. 4, Jay-Z's is Dec. 4, they were married on April 4, 2008, and her latest album is entitled 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabnamku6SxjKGgp6yjYq61edahmK1lmaPAsbXRnptmmpyqsm611bKqZqaRorJufo9qaWpsZmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-nikki-benz-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Nikki Benz Dating Now</span></a>
