The R&B singer, who’s currently working on her fourth studio album, admitted she’s “kinda” dating after <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> caught up with her at the launch of the <strong>PrettyLittleThing x Ashanti Swim </strong>collaboration at the Hollywood Roosevelt on June 30. We poked further — is Ashanti seeing someone special, or just having fun? “I guess a combination!” she admitted during our EXCLUSIVE interview. The “Rock Wit U” singer can even see someone else in her chair for future lap dances…yes, besides <strong>Ginuwine</strong>, 48!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ashanti grinded on the singer who made the ultimate grinding anthem — “Pony” — at her and <strong>Ja Rule’s</strong> concert in May. Reflecting on her impromptu lap dance with Ginuwine, Ashanti told HollywoodLife, “The lap dance has been a part of my show for a very long time. That was hilarious because I actually got stuck to him which was hilarious, but I had so much fun. He was a cool sport. It was good! The crowd was hilarious they were laughing so hard.” You can relive the steamy on-stage moment below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Don’t worry, because Ashanti promised that there’s “absolutely” more lap dances to come in the future. While considering who Ginuwine’s lap dance successor could be, the singer didn’t have a particular name in mind: “I don’t know! I gotta think about it.” Before living up the single life, Ashanti most famously dated fellow R&B singer <strong>Nelly</strong>, 44, for 10 years until splitting in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ashanti-teases-shes-in-a-relationship-chats-about-her-viral-lap-dance-with-genuine-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ashanti’s work with PrettyLittleThing didn’t end with her swimwear collaboration. She wore her own lime green snakeskin bikini to perform at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PrettyLittleThing X Saweetie show</a> at New York Fashion Week on Sept. 8! The “Foolish” singer looked fierce as she commanded the mic, and we can’t wait for the new music to drop — she teased even more details about the forthcoming album in the rest of our interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH16e49yZpqrmJa7tbWMrZyaq5Woeqq6jKucpZmknryvv8eip2ackam2r7OMpaCfnV2ctq%2FB1qKlnmWclr1usMCnmp5lmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-zac-austin-clark-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Zac Austin Clark Dating Now</span></a>
