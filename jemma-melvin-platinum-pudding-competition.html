Grease and line the 2 Swiss roll tins with baking paper.</li><li>In a large bowl, beat the egg and sugar together with an electric hand whisk for approximately 5 minutes or until light and pale.</li><li>Use a metal spoon and gently fold in the flour - do this carefully so you don't knock out the air.</li><li>Divide between the two tins and bake for 10–12 minutes or until the sponges are lightly golden and cooked through.</li><li>Sprinkle some extra caster sugar on two sheets of baking paper then turn the sponges out onto the sugared paper.</li><li>Peel off the paper from the underside and, while still warm, gently roll them both up from the short end into a tight spiral using the paper to help.</li><li>Leave them to cool while you make the lemon curd.</li><p><strong>For the lemon curd:</strong></p><li>Put the egg yolks, granulated sugar, butter, lemon zest and lemon juice in a glass bowl suspended over a saucepan of simmering water - do not let the bowl touch the hot water.</li><li>Whisk until mixed and continue to whisk while the curd cooks. Do this until it has thickened - this should take about 15 minutes.</li><li>Pour into a clean bowl and set aside to cool.</li><p><strong>For the St Clement's jelly:</strong></p><li>Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 5 minutes to soften.</li><li>Using a vegetable peeler, peel 6 strips from a lemon and 6 strips from an orange.</li><li>Place these into a saucepan with the sugar and 400ml/14fl oz water.</li><li>Bring to a simmer over a medium heat and occasionally stir until the sugar has dissolved.</li><li>Remove from the heat and throw away the peel.</li><li>Squeeze the gelatine until there is no more water and stir this into the pan until it is dissolved.</li><li>Leave this to cool.</li><li>Squeeze the lemons and oranges, so you have 150ml/5fl oz of both lemon and orange juice.</li><li>Stir into the pan then strain the jelly through a fine sieve into a jug.</li><li>Let this chill until it is cool but not set.</li><p><strong>For the custard:</strong></p><li>Place the cream in a saucepan over a gentle heat and bring it up to simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.</li><li>In a bowl, put the egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and lemon extract.</li><li>Whisk these together until mixed</li><li>Gradually pour the hot cream into the bowl, whisking continuously while you do so.</li><li>Immediately return the whole lot back to the saucepan on a gentle heat.</li><li>Continue whisking until the custard is thick and smooth.</li><li>Pour the custard into a jug or bowl and cover the surface with greaseproof paper.</li><li>Once again, leave this to cool.</li><p><strong>For the amaretti biscuits:</strong></p><li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.</li><li>In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until firm.</li><li>Mix the sugar and almonds gently into it.</li><li>Add the amaretto and fold in gently until you have a smooth paste.</li><li>Place some baking paper on a baking tray and lightly brush with butter or oil.</li><li>Using a teaspoon, place small heaps of the mixture approximately 2cm/¾in apart, as they will expand during cooking.</li><li>Bake for approximately 15–20 minutes or until golden brown.</li><li>Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.</li><p><strong>For the chunky mandarin coulis:</strong></p><li>Strain two of the mandarin cans and throw away the juice.</li><li>Put the fruit into a saucepan with the sugar and heat gently until broken down.</li><li>Remove from the heat.</li><li>In a small bowl, mix the arrowroot with 2 tablespoons cold water - in the baking world the mixing of a thickening agent is known as slake.</li><li>To your slaked mixture, add to the warm mandarins.</li><li>Add the lemon juice and mix well.</li><li>Pour the mixture into a large bowl.</li><li>Strain the remaining two tins of mandarins and add the fruit to the bowl then leave to cool completely.</li><p><strong>For the jewelled chocolate bark:</strong></p><li>Melt the white chocolate in a bowl which is sitting over a saucepan of gently simmering water.</li><li>If the mixed peel feels wet or sticky, roll it in the caster sugar to absorb any moisture.</li><li>Pour the white chocolate onto a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li><li>Cover the mixed peel with the melted chocolate.</li><li>Leave to set, then break into shards.</li><p><strong>To assemble:</strong></p><li>Unroll the cooled Swiss rolls and spread the lemon curd over the inside.</li><li>Roll back up again and slice one into 2.5cm/1in slices and place upright around the bottom edge of the trifle dish so the swirl is visible.</li><li>Slice the other Swiss roll into thicker pieces and use these to fill the bottom of the dish - make sure this is roughly the same level as the slices that line the edge.</li><li>Use off-cuts of sponge to fill any gaps.</li><li>Pour the St Clement’s jelly over the Swiss roll layer and set aside in the fridge to completely set - this will take around 3 hours.</li><li>Once set, pour over the custard.</li><li>Drop a single layer of amaretti biscuits into the custard - make sure you save a few for decorating the top.</li><li>Pour over the mandarin coulis.</li><li>In a separate bowl, whip the double cream until soft peaks form then spoon this over the coulis.</li><li>Decorate with the reserved amaretti biscuits - crumble some of them while keeping other whoel.</li><li>Finally place the chocolate bark shards into the top of the trifle.</li><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>To save time you can use pre-made parts of this recipe such as ready made amaretti biscuits.</p><p>You can decorate how you wish, with white chocolate chunks rather than the bark if this is more to your taste.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Queen's Platinum Jubilee</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ROYAL-Queen-09075085jpg-JS634480995.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Everything to know about the Queen's Platinum Jubilee</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoV1fZVqa3Bnmpq6rq2MppylrpmjerG4wK2gp62dYr22sMOipaBlk6S6sbHToquip55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosie-odonnell-and-tatum-oneal-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Rosie O'Donnell and Tatum O'Neal: Dating!</span></a>
