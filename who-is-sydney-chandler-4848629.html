Sydney has a younger sister named&nbsp;<strong>Sawyer</strong>. The Chandler family lives outside of Austin, Texas, though they frequent Los Angeles due to Kyle and Sydney’s Hollywood career connections.</p><h2>She plays Violet in ‘Don’t Worry Darling’.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sydney’s Don’t Worry Darling&nbsp;character&nbsp;is a housewife and friend of Alice Chambers (played by Florence Pugh). They live in Victory, California, where their husbands work on the secret “Victory Project” which sparks Alice’s suspicions. Sydney explained how she related to Violet as a newcomer to Hollywood in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WWD</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Me, myself as Sydney was very new to this world, and so I felt my character very, very quickly, just kind of stepping in and soaking up the vibe on set and seeing how all of it works,” she said. “And so that kind of translated really perfectly for my character.”</p><h2>She was in a show about the Sex Pistols.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sydney had a lead role in the FX on Hulu miniseries&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pistols</a>, about <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sex Pistols</strong> </a>guitarist <strong>Steve Jones</strong> and the band’s rise to fame. She played <strong>Chrissie Hynde</strong>, founding member of the Pretenders who almost married Steve and his bandmate&nbsp;<strong>Johnny Rotten&nbsp;</strong>for a work permit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sydney-chandler-5-things-to-know-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>She didn’t want to be an actor at first.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>“My dad’s an actor, and so you never want to do what your parents are doing,” Sydney explained in her&nbsp;WWD&nbsp;interview. “So I stayed very far away from that. And then I wanted to be a vet, and then I think it was my last year of high school when I was failing my math and my science, I was like, ‘maybe not.’ And then I went into creative writing, and I ended up taking an acting class in Austin here in town when I was studying for my writing. And I wanted to just do a character study on writers, on actors, and see people trying to act, that would be an interesting person to evaluate. And then I ended up just absolutely falling in love with it. My acting coach said, ‘you can stay in the class if you start auditioning,’ and it all just kind of went from there.”</p><h2>Her dad’s given her advice.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kyle, who is also famous from the movies&nbsp;<i>Manchester by the Sea</i>,&nbsp;The Wolf of Wall Street, and&nbsp;First Man, has been there for his daughter as she follows in his footsteps professionally.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“He’s been extremely supportive and we actually, we’ve had some really good talks about, you know. I want to make my own way through this, my own path through this, with my work,” Sydney told WWD. “And he’s been really, really just supportive. He’s my dad. He’s there for me,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LAurDNnrBmm5iWu6W4xKtkbXBkbYNzhY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flip-or-flop-ending-season-11-hgtv-series-finale.html><span>←</span><span>Tarek &amp;amp; Christinas Statements Hollywood Life</span></a>
