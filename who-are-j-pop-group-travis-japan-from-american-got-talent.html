The judges and live audience were thrilled by the dancing group’s coordinated routines and different personalities. The AGT participants are a group of seven. They began in 2012, under the direction of American choreographer Travis Payne.</p><h2>Travis Japan, an AGT J-pop group, was formed as children</h2><p>Travis Japan is a song-and-dance entertainment group handled by Johnny & Associates, a prominent Japanese talent agency. In 2012, they were in Johnny’s junior unit and had their stage debut as youngsters when they auditioned for famed American choreographer Travis Payne.</p><p>The group’s seven members are as follows:</p><li>Kaito Matsukura</li><li>Ryuya Shimekake</li><li>Shizuya Yoshizawa</li><li>Kaito Miyachika</li><li>Noel Kawashima</li><li>Kaito Nakamura</li><li>Genta Matsuda</li><p>Nakada Hiroki, Abe Aran, Morita Myuto, and Kajiyama Asahi are former members of the group.&nbsp;During its 2012 founding, the group was split into two groups: Ani-gumi (an elder brother group comprised of Nakada, Kawashima, Morita, and Shimekake) and Otouto-gumi (a younger brother group consisting of Yoshizawa, Nakamura, Abe, Miyachika, Kajiyama). Initially just performing for Playzone, the two teams were recruited as dancers for Kondo Masahiko’s 35th-anniversary tour in 2015.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/J-pop-Group-Travis-Japan-2.jpg alt="J-pop Group Travis Japan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They played as a nine-person crew at Johnny’s Ginza in 2016. They were hailed for their incredible enthusiasm and dance abilities. However, once Abe Aran announced his decision to quit the group, they continued to perform as an 8-member dance group.&nbsp;Nakada departed in January 2017 to pursue other possibilities, and the group grew to seven dancers. Morito and Kaiyama both opted to quit after encountering various barriers, leaving the group with just five members. They did, however, perform at Johnny’s Jr. Wangan LIVE on November 18, 2017, with two new dancers, Matsuda Genta and Matsukura Kaito. Since then, the ensemble has performed with all seven members.</p><p>The AGT candidates elected to grow their careers in Hollywood and hone their abilities as performers at the end of March 2022. They have been in Los Angeles since then, where they attend daily singing, dance, and English classes.&nbsp;The AGT J-pop group also competed in the World of Dance Championship Series Orange County 2022, finishing third in the Team Division and winning Best Costume and Crowd Favorite. Their graphics, costumes, and acrobatics wowed the crowd.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/J-pop-Group-Travis-Japan-3.jpg alt="J-pop Group Travis Japan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Travis Japan has 841K Instagram followers, where they routinely broadcast their group dance performances, practice sessions, and promotional activities.
