Although they are good cases with bright selection of colour, they are not necessarily the most cost effective.</p><p>Having a tempered glass screen protector is often more important that the case itself as more often than not it will be your screen to break not the back.</p><p>Even your basic clear plastic case can vary in quality, look for ones which have a lip around the camera or are thicker to make sure you have the best protection.</p><p>At the end of the day, while you want some protection, the main point of a case is self expression so choose one you like that suits your needs.</p><h2>What colour iPhone 13 is most popular?</h2><p>It's hard to pin down which colour is the most popular as many people will opt for the classic Midnight shade for reselling purposes.</p><p>Many sources have said that the new Pink colour is the best seller for the iPhone 13, along with Midnight.</p><p>Although this is to be taken with a pinch of salt as the same sources also state the Pink is most popular for the iPhone 13 Pro too - which is not available.</p><p>New colour Sierra Blue proved to be popular with buyers, much like its predecessor Pacific Blue was in the 12 Pro model.</p><p>Apple brought back the popular dark green (known as Midnight Green back then) from the 11 Pro range and repackaged it as Alpine Green for the 13 Pros.</p><p>Plain colours remain constant sellers and are sometimes easer to sell second-hand once you're done with it, while new colours tend to be hit or miss with customers.</p><h2>Which iPhone case is the most popular?</h2><p>Due to the sheer number of cases around it is hard to tell which case is most popular.</p><p>Apple's own silicone cases are always a big seller as people like the soft-touch feel and brand authority, plus there is a massive colour selection.</p><p>Other trusted brands like Otterbox tend to be popular, especially with their clear options.</p><p>Big brands such as Casetify and Quadlock can be higher in cost but remain popular for specific audiences who can invest, much like Apple case purchasers.</p><p>Fashion brands like SkinnyDip and Coconut Lane have also been successful in cornering the pretty case market, although there are a wide range of sellers on sites like Etsy.</p><h2>Should I buy a cover for my iPhone 13?</h2><p>Some brave people do not put a case on their iPhones because they want to appreciate the phone they purchased in it's full glory.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>There's nothing wrong with not putting a cover on your phone, although do make sure you have insurance as a screen repair on the iPhone 13 will set you back around £266.</p><p>If you are clumsy or even just want to protect your phone from little daily scratches - such as being in your pocket with your keys - then a case is the best thing for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2cnKBfZoV0fZhyaGlnkprAtXnIqZ%2BoppVifnR5wpqqnmWUmq6tv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-who-never-graduated-high-school.html><span>←</span><span>Stars Who Never Graduated High School: Jennifer Lawrence, More</span></a>
