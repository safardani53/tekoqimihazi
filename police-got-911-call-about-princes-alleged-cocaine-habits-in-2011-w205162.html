He advised her last year in Germany that he cannot control his habit and she was advised to report it.” The name of the female was not listed and her phone number was redacted. Although the tip was unverified, Prince did travel to Germany in 2010 for his 20Ten Tour.</p><p>The Sheriff’s Department noted in the log that since the info was a year old and the caller did not specify the late singer was in immediate danger, they wouldn’t be able to take any action, and the incident was marked as closed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>One of the last calls in the log was from April 21, the day of his death, and the log notes “one down not breathing.” The pop icon was found dead at age 57 in the elevator of his Paisley Park recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. An autopsy was completed, but the cause of death has yet to be released. Investigators revealed they’re currently examining whether Prince died of an overdose since he was found with prescription painkillers in his possession and in his home.</p><p><span>Other entries in the log include information about minor incidents, such as fire alarms, trespassers and suspicious vehicles at Paisley Park.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapp5yesKZ5xqirZnFhZnqkrculZJqan6rBbrzRoqWcnaNirq24xKCcnWWTpLCitc2eZKGZkp7BtHnIp2RraGFmerh%2Bj25ob2pf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./epsom-funfair-two-children-injured.html><span>←</span><span>Epsom funfair: Dad of girl, 16, gives update after teen and boy, 7, hurt 'sliding off' of Crazy F</span></a>
