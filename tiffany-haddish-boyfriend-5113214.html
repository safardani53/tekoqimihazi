The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>43-year-old Emmy winner</a> has been married twice (to the same guy!), and she has been in a handful of public relationships over the years. In June 2023, Tiffany and her fellow comedian <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reggie Watts </strong></a>seemingly confirmed a romance when Reggie, 51, shared a selfie with Tiffany on his Instagram page on June 5. “Hey we’re dating,” he wrote in the caption, as seen below. “And we made money on our first date!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It is not clear if the duo was simply trolling fans or being serious about their relationship. Both of them were single before the dating rumors started, so it’s not too far-fetched of an idea that they are together and decided to confirm their romance to end speculation. Learn about Tiffany Haddish’s boyfriend and romance history below.</p><h2>Tiffany Haddish And Reggie Watts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tiffany-haddish-reggie-watts-ev-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Very little is known about Tiffany and Reggie’s potential romance. In the comment section of Reggie’s selfie above, Tiffany commented that she is “ready for [date] two” and also shared the image to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Story</a>. “1st date and I am loving it so much,” the Like a Boss star wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Reggie, for those who don’t know, is an “internationally renowned vocal artist/ beatboxer/ musician/ comedian,” per his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>, who performs live in front of fans using looper pedals, instruments, and his voice. He makes up his shows on the spot, meaning no two performances are alike. In 2010, he opened for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Conan O’Brien</strong></a>‘s sold-out Prohibited From Being Funny on Television tour. The same year, he released his debut comedy project called Why $#!+ So Crazy? He has performed at some of the world’s largest festivals, including Bonnaroo and SXSW, and even at the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> 2012 TED Conference</a>.</p><h2>Tiffany Haddish And William Stewart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tiffany-haddish-ev-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tiffany was once a married woman. That’s right: She was married to and divorced from a man named <strong>William Stewart</strong> twice from 2008 to 2013. Their union allegedly ended due to the abuse Tiffany was subject to from her former lover. In Tiffany’s 2018’s memoir, The Last Black Unicorn, she alleged he was emotionally and physically abusive. In one portion of her book, Tiffany wrote about William allegedly lashing out at her at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal because he was upset she was speaking to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Green</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“He grabbed me by the collar, he was like, ‘It’s time to go to the room now,’ in front of everybody,” she claimed (via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>). “Just snatched me by my shirt, and pulled me to the elevator and threw me in it…once we got to our hotel room, he was so quick. He snatched me by the neck and slammed me into the wall.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>William sued his ex-wife and Simon & Schuster, the publisher of The Last Black Unicorn, for defamation after the book came out. In the court docs, which were obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Blast</a>, William accused Tiffany of fabricating stories to obtain a temporary restraining order against him. “Ms. Haddish recanted the allegations in the TRO and pled with law enforcement to dismiss the TRO because it was untrue,” the docs reportedly said. “In fact, she confessed to attacking Mr. Stewart.”</p><h2>Tiffany Haddish And Common</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tiffany-haddish-common-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tiffany and rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Common</strong> </a>first met on the set of The Kitchen in 2019, in which they played each other’s love interests. “We became friends but it wasn’t like anything sexual or anything like that because … my eyes were set on something else,” she recalled on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Steve-O’</strong>s Wild Ride podcast</a> in July 2020. She then admitted she hopped on Bumble to start dating around, after which she was approached by Bumble for a partnership. She and the “Invocation” rapper had been chatting more at that point, but weren’t official.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I had been talking to Common, and hanging out… like he comes to play spades with me and my friends and stuff,” she said. “And then I mentioned it to him, and at this point our friendship was getting a little more than friendship but not quite ’cause COVID happened and we’re like quarantined.” They decided to do a partnership with Bumble, and their<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> first virtual date</a> occurred in April 2020. By July, they were officially dating.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In August of that year, Common was happy to talk about his romance with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the Girls Trip star</a> during a virtual appearance on<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Live With Kelly and Ryan</a>. “She’s a wonderful woman, a queen, and just a beautiful person, man,” he gushed. “I just care for her a lot, enjoy her, and am grateful to have her in my life. So yeah, I’m happy!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Sadly, the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> couple broke up</a> by Nov. 2021. “It was an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amicable split</a>. They both still think very highly of one another, work obligations simply proved to be too much for them to move forward,” a person close to the former co-stars told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> E! News </a>at the time. “[They] ultimately decided to end things before continuing on with a long-distance relationship,” they added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OinZ%2BZnq56qa3DnaCsoF2XvLqy0aKcp5xdan5yf5Fqa2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./filipe-toledo.html><span>←</span><span>Filipe Toledo</span></a>
