I can quote the nonsensical poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll from beginning to end.</p><p>3. I got into Princeton University [but] couldn’t afford it and got a scholarship offer from Rutgers University where I attended.</p><p>4. I took a year of Russian in college and can still make out the letters, but that’s about it!</p><p>5. My favorite thing to do at night is watch a movie with my kids and dogs (and my husband). My kids no longer cuddle, but my dogs do.</p><p>6. I am petrified of snakes after a close encounter with one in Panama as a young girl.</p><p>7. I will never scuba dive. I am too claustrophobic.</p><p>8. I was born in Taiwan and was an Air Force brat. I moved about seven times as a kid before college.</p><p>9. My first concert was Spandau Ballet in Madrid. “True” is still one of my favorite songs.</p><p>10. Growing up, I [wanted to be] a veterinarian.</p><p>11. My dream was to have a horse. And now I do! His name is Houdini and I’m finally riding and learning to jump.</p><p>12. If I could play any instrument I would play the cello. I love <strong>Yo-Yo Ma</strong>.</p><p>13. There is nothing I love more to eat than Patsy’s Pizzeria in New York City.</p><p>14. My first time on TV was in a commercial in Spain.</p><p>15. My most embarrassing, while also humorous moment, on Today was when I got a lesson on how to sing from <a href=#><strong>Liza Minnelli</strong></a>. I was a disaster and she literally said, “Natalie, please stop!”</p><p>16. I love to sing out loud — [even] though I sing off-key and always mess up the lyrics.</p><p>17. I often get mixed up with actress <strong>Natalie Morales</strong>. She has also had people mistake her for me.</p><p>18. As a young girl, <a href=#><strong>Olivia Newton-John</strong></a> was my idol. I would dress up and roller skate around like [her character] in Xanadu. I never dreamed she would now be a wonderful friend.</p><p>19. My first job out of college was in finance working in a management training program with then Chemical Bank (now JPMorgan Chase).</p><p>20. I would rather have wine than dessert.</p><p>21. I am addicted to organizing my closet.</p><p>22. Reading is my favorite escape.</p><p>23. I have a recurring nightmare that my mouth is filled with glue or that my teeth are falling out!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. My favorite smell is the smell of my dogs.</p><p>25. By now you know animals are my passion. My dream one day [is] to have a ranch that would be a sanctuary for rescues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp6Wnu6K4yKyrZqaRqa6ttcRmpKiqkaGytHmRbmStoJmjtLR52KisZpyfo8Fut82ormaZkqTCtXnMnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dawn-foster.html><span>←</span><span>Dawn Foster- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Dating, Height, Ethnicity</span></a>
