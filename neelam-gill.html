Neelam Gill&nbsp;(born Neelam Johal&nbsp;on November 30, 1994 in Coventry, United Kingdom)&nbsp;is a British model. She was first scouted at 14 years old, but stayed in school until graduation, so she didn’t get her start in the industry until she was 17. Neelam’s very first runway show was for Burberry in Sept. 2013, and that spring, she became the first Indian to star in an ad for the brand. She’s since done more work for Burberry, and has also modeled for&nbsp;Kanye West’s Adidas line."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
