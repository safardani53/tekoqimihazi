This is especially true for&nbsp;Amber Portwood.
The troubled reality star was just arrested late last week on a felony charge of domstic violence against boyfriend Andrew Glennon.
And while she waits to attend a hearing currently scheduled for Wednesday morning, MTV aired an episode of Teen Mom OG on Monday evening that featured Portwood delving into her history of mental illness… specifically how it has caused her to turn violent in the past."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And then I had borderline personality disorder, BPD. That stems more from your childhood and things that you went through."</p><p>Portwood also admitted that she’s on medication and actually used to be on even heavier medication.</p><p>"Obviously since the day we started this show, I’ve been f-cking nuts, so I mean, come on," Amber said, only half joking.</p><p>"Don’t talk to yourself like that," Catelynn responded.</p><p>"I mean, you know what I mean. Like, I’ve been beating up people, going in jail and all that," Amber actually said, eerily previewing the assault arrest that took place months after this scene was shot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Portwood, of course, was also arrested back in 2010 for attacking then-boyfriend Gary Shirley.</p><p>After violating the terms of her probation that resulted from this arrest, Amber spent 17 months in jail in 2013 and 2014.</p><p>That was then — and, now, it’s tragic that not a lot has changed for Portwood.</p><p>At one point on this episode, she experienced major anxiety while out shopping because the women were surrounded by the paparazzi.</p><p>Ironically, though, Amber spoke to Andrew about it and he encouraged her to remain positive and to have fun with her co-stars. He even sent her a bouquet of flowers, as you can see here:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I’ve never had a guy that’s ever treated me like this. I feel weird. I have to train myself to do that because I’m not used to it," Amber said about Andrew’s act of kindess… which, again, is sadly ironic, given what reportedly transpired this past Friday.</p><p><a href=#>Glennon thought Amber might really hurt both himself and their son</a>.</p><p>According to the official Indiana police report, Portwood struck Andrew in the neck with a shoe around 2 a.m. on July 5.</p><p>"I need help," Andrew wrote in a text message to 911 after this happened. "My life and my son’s life is in danger."</p><p>Officers on the scene then observed scratches and red marks on Andrew’s neck, while an evidence technician took photographs of the injuries.</p><p>"Ms. Portwood stated that she did indeed strike (her boyfriend) with a shoe," Metropolitan Police Department Officer Ryan Salisbury wrote in his report.&nbsp;"But stated that ‘it was in the shoulder and I barely hit him.’"</p><p>Neither Portwood nor Glennon has commented on the arrest of alleged assault at this time.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Andrew Glennon: Is He About to Dump Amber Portwood?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WEcK3Mm5yrZaCkv7XDzqibZpyVqa6quNJmpJ6mpJa5brDIrKarnJWneqKwzKKrrGWZonqnecKkoKefXaPCtb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-oliu-20020311-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Oliu (World Music Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
