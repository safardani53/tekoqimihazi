But his parents work to keep his legacy alive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@thevictorboyce</a></figure><p>Disney Channel actor <a href=#>Cameron Boyce</a> unfortunately passed away in July 2019. In a statement, a spokesperson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> on behalf of his family that he had a seizure in his sleep. It was later reported that Cameron had been diagnosed with epilepsy. Naturally, his untimely death left many fans distraught over his passing.</p><p>But two of the people who have been hit the hardest by <a href=#>Cameron's death</a> are his parents, Victor and Libby Boyce. They have been working hard to make sure their son's memory lives on. They both consistently post about their son on their Instagram accounts and even created a foundation in his name. Here's what we know about Cameron's parents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: The Cameron Boyce Foundation</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cameron Boyce's parents are working to keep their son's legacy alive.</h2><p>In the aftermath of Cameron's death, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victor and Libby spoke to ABC News</a> in August 2019 about their plans to continue his legacy. "It's not clich√© to say you never know," said Victor. He says that the night Cameron died, they were texting about sports. All three of them had just been out to dinner hours before.</p><p>"He was amazing," Libby said about her son. She went on to call him "extremely wise" and said that Cameron would ask her to share her wisdom with him. "Who says that," Victor and Libby asked. Part of keeping Cameron's legacy alive is the creation of The Cameron Boyce Foundation. According to the foundation's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram bio</a>, it was created to not only honor Cameron, but to also cure epilepsy and support causes the actor was passionate about.</p><p>In the ABC News interview, Libby said that these issues and the water crisis were all things he deeply cared about. Those are the issues that the foundation focuses on. "You know, I can never fill my son's shoes, ever, even though my foot is bigger than his," Victor says. "But we're gonna try to continue his legacy as best we can because it's just too important to just let it die."</p><p>On Instagram, both parents share pics of Cameron with small glimpses into his life or the family's life. Going through both of their accounts, you can kind of piece together what he was like through their eyes.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One post by Victor says</a>: "The simple pleasures. My son‚Äôs life was short but it was beautiful üñ§"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Cameron Boyce die?</h2><p>Cameron died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) which caused him to suffer a seizure in his sleep. His mother Libby revealed in a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TODAY</a> that her son suffered his first seizure when he was 16 and a half. "It was in his sleep. It was a night when he had two friends sleeping over and they witnessed it,‚Äù Libby recalled.</p><p>About a year after that, Cameron was diagnosed with epilepsy, though his mom says it didn‚Äôt cause too much interference with his daily life. In fact, Cameron had only suffered ‚Äúfive seizures in his life‚Äù before he passed on July 6, 2019. Cameron was only 20 years old at the time of his death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Cameron Boyce Foundation announced a partnership with Sofia Carson.</h2><p>Just shy of what would have been Cameron's 22nd birthday, his father announced the partnership on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram</a>. They teamed up to release limited edition T-shirts and jackets on May 28, 2021. In its own Instagram post, the foundation posted a pic of Cameron and Sofia together with a statement from her.</p><p>"Cam changed my world. Forever," it begins. "In his honor, we must follow the footsteps he so bravely left behind and we must believe that together, 'we can change the world.'</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Cameron Boyce Foundation (@thecameronboycefoundation)</a></p></figure><p>She went on: "Cam's selfless heart lives in the extraordinary work of The Cameron Boyce Foundation.
