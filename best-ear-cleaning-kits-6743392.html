Plus, Dr. Chandrasekhar says, the wax itself protects the ear canal from infections. That’s all good and well, assuming you’re not sticking anything into your ears on a regular basis. But now that we have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>in-ear headphones</a>, ear plugs, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hearing aids</a>, cleaning the ears has become more important, audiologist, executive director and founder of HEAR 4U International <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">H. Christopher Schweitzer, PhD</a> tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the typical DIY methods have involved cotton swabs and bobby pins, both can do more harm than good (which we’ll get into below). With that in mind, we’ve asked our two experts to walk us through the best ear-cleaning kits, and how to use them. Since ear hygiene is highly personalized and specific to each person’s conditions, we can’t determine the best overall ear wax kit based on testing insights from our lab. However, with the help of expert knowledge and extensive product research, we hope the below insights help you find the best ear-cleaning kit for your needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover our picks for the best ear-cleaning kits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-waxiway-ear-wax-removal-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>WAXIWAY Ear Wax Removal Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Waxiway Ear Wax Removal Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6GdltcRlkv5l_BuQ5xPMbs5yCUc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/waxiway-ear-wax-removal-kit-c1368c6354f24c8d91f469d8038b450a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This kit fits the standard for ear wax removal solutions, which Dr. Schweitzer says usually “include a bulb or traditional syringe with a plastic or rubber tip.” He says these are used “to force a stream of solution, often including some combination of peroxide, glycerin, and other ingredients, towards the upper portion of the ear canal to help soften and flood the trapped cerumen back down and out.” Think of it as a gentle rinse, in which a liquid takes the place of a manual tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that this kit comes with every component you’ll need to perform the cleaning. This version uses a saline solution to loosen ear wax and flush it out, and it even comes with a basin and towel for easy cleanup. (Plus, you'll also get an ear bulb to remove any excess water.) <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Some users</a> said it worked better than other products they used that were almost twice the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering the affordable price, comprehensiveness, and reusability of the set, this ear-cleaning kit snagged our top spot. While it has a basin, it might be challenging to hold the basin in place with one hand while spraying water precisely with the other. So, if you are tackling this process solo, you can always ditch the basin and go old school, using the spray while leaning over the sink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Irrigation | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 5<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrogen-peroxide-kit-qisxrovy-ear-cleaning-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hydrogen Peroxide Kit</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>QISXROVY Ear-Cleaning Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="QISXROVY Ear-Cleaning Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FO5cVQU0--v9EsC8HYkpHFMVFno=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/qisxrovy-ear-cleaning-kit-0f037d690d0e429e8a7cccd3709c9a80.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re nervous about spraying a cleaning solution into your ears, consider hydrogen peroxide, a tried-and-true remedy that releases oxygen into the wax buildup to slowly soften and break it up, creating a bubble-like sensation you can hear. Dr. Chandrasekhar says hydrogen peroxide-based kits are some of “the safest.” That’s because it’s a commonly used liquid and experts know exactly how much to use that won’t cause any damage (no more than five to 10 drops in your ears; and mix with water).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This kit works with a solution of hydrogen peroxide, which, we should note, isn’t included (<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a>). That said, it comes with a handy storage box to keep everything organized and 40 disposable tips for added value. Once you combine lukewarm water and hydrogen peroxide in the spray bottle, you can then spritz the solution into the clogged ear, where you can allow it to sit for a few minutes to soften the ear wax. Then, use the silicone bulb to remove the solution from the ears (and any dissolved ear wax). For any stragglers, the kit also includes looped tools that can be used to manually pull the wax out. It’s easier to use this kit with two people, but it's still feasible for one.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Irrigation | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 40</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hearing-aids-tilcare-ear-wax-removal-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hearing Aids</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tilcare Ear Wax Removal Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tilcare Ear Wax Removal Tool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/spk7jEO9duK7dNkHzkJOhWDkq-4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tilcare-ear-wax-removal-tool-e1d112d5556d4cfca7268d16342387ab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hearing aids are known to contribute to wax buildup, and thanks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>recent FDA approval</a>, they’re likely to be a well-used over-the-counter solution for mild to moderate hearing loss. If you wear hearing aids, Dr. Chandrasekhar suggests having “your ears checked at least once per year” or more often if you think your ears are “clogged” or your hearing aids are acting up, “presumably due to wax accumulation.” She adds that while using hearing aids helps with communication, they can “block the ear’s natural cleaning mechanism to some degree” so wearers should be more conscious about ear care.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If that’s the case, this gentle rinse can help. Not only does it come with 30 disposable tips to keep it hygienic amid frequent usage, but the spray bottle also features a softer spray — and can be filled with a hydrogen peroxide solution. The only downside of a gentle solution is it might take a few tries to get all the wax out — not a dealbreaker by any means, but perhaps a con to some. Like our best overall pick, this kit is also a comprehensive set with a basin, towel, and ear bulb, so you have everything you need in one place when it’s time to clean your ears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Irrigation | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 30</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-manual-cleaning-tool-ototek-loop-ear-wax-removal-device></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Manual Cleaning Tool</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ototek Loop Ear Wax Removal Device</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ototek Loop Ear Wax Removal Device" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ygz9lb3aKCFHJgyzIsDWmpsqucU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ototek-loop-ear-wax-removal-device-0f46391340b34b48b5e3ca28101e33f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This plastic loop kit is a good option to consider if you’re anti-irrigation — meaning you don’t want to spray or pour liquid in your ears. “Plastic loops are included with some kits,” says Dr. Schweitzer, who recommends approaching these with extreme caution. While you should avoid sticking objects in your ears, especially the dreaded cotton swap (somewhere an audiologist just cringed), “careful use” of a plastic loop can be “effective for pulling out the wax,” says Dr. Schweitzer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This tool almost acts like a hollowed-out spoon, allowing you to manipulate the wax and maneuver it out of the ear canal:&nbsp;a delightfully simple task. And there are safety measures in place to help avoid any accidents. Since it's made of plastic, it's unlikely to scratch, and the tool includes a safety stopper that prevents you from sticking it in too far. It can also be endlessly washed and reused, although since it’s a plastic tool, it’s prone to breaking if you put enough pressure on it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Manual | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 0</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-easiest-to-use-vafee-soft-silicone-ear-cleaning-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Easiest to Use</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vafee Soft Silicone Ear Cleaning Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vafee Soft Silicone Ear Cleaning Tool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9g7c58xYBtttGK0QseHhYfZ1Gvo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vafee-soft-silicone-ear-cleaning-tool-d2fdf9d0a6ed4642b20ba879c03d97ad.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned earlier, generic cotton swabs are generally regarded as a no-go by experts. “They will mostly push the wax in deeper, past the middle narrowing of the ear canal which is called the isthmus,” says Dr. Chandrasekhar. (Plus, they can scratch the skin of the ear canal, leading to bleeding, pain, and even the risk of infection.) That’s where this handy tool is different. While it may be similar in use to your average Q-tip, it contains a spiraled head that gives wax a place to go: namely, outside your ear, versus farther inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To prevent scratches, the tool features a disposable, soft silicone tip attached to an ergonomic handle, which allows you to twist it according to the direction of the arrow on the handle. Though, like any object you stick in your ears, it's better to start slowly rather than risk going too deep into the ear canal. It’s an easy tool to maintain because the body of the device is washable, and the tips are disposable, which makes for quick cleanup, too. Plus, it comes with 16 replacement tips. And should you be dealing with hard wax, we suggest using hydrogen peroxide to break it up first, and then using this tool to pull it out once softened.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Manual | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 16</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-softening-debrox-earwax-removal-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Softening</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Debrox Earwax Removal Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Earwax Removal Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4epRR6ygtqJkCfafu-aRWyqdGdE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/debrox-earwax-removal-kit-c7939379248645be9d661e1f678705e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While new ear wax is already soft, “older wax can get hard and become entangled in hairs in the cerumen-producing gland,” says Dr. Schweitzer. “Ear-softening products can be helpful in that case.” You can also use them to prep your ears ahead of irrigation removal (or manual removal, as mentioned above). “Hard, dry buildups may take several treatments,” Dr. Schweitzer notes. (Still no luck? You might need to visit your doctor, he says.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This ear-cleaning kit pairs liquid drops, powered by carbamide peroxide (a water-soluble cousin to hydrogen peroxide), to soften tough ear wax before you flush it with water. It also comes with a bulb, which helps remove any excess moisture by suctioning it out with manual air pressure (via squeezing it). The drops also create a tiny lather, so you feel like it's working, too. With drops like these, it may help to lie down for a few minutes after applying so the liquid doesn’t run out of your ear before it breaks up the wax.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Drops only | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Irrigation | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 0</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-kids-bonny-ears-ear-wax-removal-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Kids</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bonny Ears Ear Wax Removal Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1368 data-sizes=750px alt="Bonny Ears Ear Wax Removal Tool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/V_Bf5SS0Uh950a_BUTari8ifcco=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bonnyearremovaltool-40569635e6bc4490afad4d6cebac9302.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Infants, toddlers, and kids get ear wax, too — in fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>research has found</a> that one in 10 children experiences ear wax buildup. While it’s tempting to take a cotton swab to your toddler’s waxy ears, hold off, since it’s more likely to push that wax into the ear canal. “This will clog the ear further and make it harder or impossible for the wax to clean itself out,” says Dr. Chandrasekhar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, make it seem fun (and less intimidating) to scrape out gunk with this cute kit, which features animals on the curette handles. These tools work similarly to the plastic loop model, but instead of a loop, there are three solid tip options each designed to scoop out wax. The kit also includes an LED light that allows you to see what you’re doing. You’ll also get silicone tip covers for a softer, more comfortable feel, and all of the tips are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reusable after washing</a>; which you should do thoroughly after each use. As always, though, proceed with caution, especially if you’re removing ear wax from another person — and therefore might not know how it feels as you’re working.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Removal method: </strong>Manual | <strong>Number of disposable tips</strong>: 12 reusable tips</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-professional-elephant-ear-washer-bottle-system-by-doctor-easy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Professional</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elephant Ear Washer Bottle System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Elephant Ear Washer Bottle System by Doctor Easy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ISvwjnQdoGymzVPNyrnAIACafbo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/elephant-ear-washer-bottle-system-by-doctor-easy-e5c45186d5ab48d888dcdf9993ad1645.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This physician-designed ear-cleaning kit is part of a collection known as “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Doctor Easy</a>”: A collection of medical products that bring clinic-level service into the comfort of home. The Elephant Ear Washer, no doubt named for its trunk-esque attachment, is an irrigation tool that flushes the wax buildup out of your ear. To use this kit, simply fill the bottle with an ear-cleaning solution (<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a>), maneuver the attachment into your ear, and spray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We suggest spraying the solution into your ear while leaning over a sink or tub to give the wax a place to go when it’s rinsed out. The kit comes with three disposable tips (so no need to clean them). And for those who might not be comfortable with an irrigation kit due to the discomfort of having water in your ear, we have manual options on our list as well. Overall, we think this would be an ideal ear-cleaning kit for someone who needs professional cleanings but might not be able to make it to the doctor’s office as often, such as those in the elderly community.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable: </strong>Yes | <strong>Removal Method:</strong> Irrigation | <strong>Number of disposable tips:</strong> 3 (larger pack sold separately)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vacuum-teadz-ear-vacuum-wax-remover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Vacuum</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TEADZ Ear Vacuum Wax Remover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-43AiYeb1ZZHgQ8gUmpOFBmtKwg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ear-vacuum-wax-remover-ear-wax-removal-5-levels-strong-suction-ear-wax-remover-usb-charge-ear-wax-vacuum-reusable-ear-wax-removal-kit-electric-ear-wax-7ea670c510ce40fe8755534f34db67a6.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who don't love the idea of manually working out ear wax, an ear vacuum can make for a better and more hands-off alternative. This battery-powered device uses suction to remove ear wax, so you don’t need to get close to the ear canal, and has five different levels of suction, which allows you to customize the strength based on your comfort level. It does come with eight ear-picking tools — which you can use to first loosen any hard plugs of wax — along with two silicone tips and a detachable tube.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We recommend starting on the lowest suction level and working your way up to the higher settings only if needed. Whatever setting you choose, the sound of the vacuum is relatively low and quiet (although if you're sensitive to loud noises or using it on a baby, consider attaching the included suction tube to keep the vacuum motor farther away from the ear). It also works best if ear wax is dry, so don't use drops right before suctioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, this gets bonus points for its ergonomic feel and intuitive design: All you have to do is press a single button to turn it on, choose your suction level, and turn it off. Then, rinse out the storage barrel with soap and water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reusable: </strong>Yes | <strong>Removal Method:</strong> Suction | <strong>Number of disposable tips:</strong> 0</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-camera-equipped-leiput-ear-wax-remover-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Camera-Equipped</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Leiput Ear Wax Remover Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vYcUeJIYevzK_3dhdZlWIyzyZcs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/_ear-wax-removal---earwax-remover-tool-with-8-pcs-ear-set---ear-cleaner-with-camera---earwax-removal-kit-with-light---ear-camera-with-6-ear-spoon-df87e43656b3436b841486766177b7ba.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you haven't had much success with removing your ear wax, consider this wireless cleaner, which is equipped with LED lights and a high-definition camera so you can see exactly what you're working with. It has a 360-degree lens for a surprisingly large field of vision and connects via Wi-Fi to an app on your phone that allows you to more easily navigate and clean the ear.

The only drawback is that all of the tips are around the same length, so you can’t get much further into the ear in the event you want to go deeper.

If you want a quality kit without a high price tag, we recommend either the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ototek Loop Ear Wax Removal Device</a> or the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Debrox Earwax Removal Kit</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All of our picks fall between $10 and $40, so depending on what you’re comfortable spending, there are lots of good options for different budgets.

For starters, “I do not recommend any of the new devices that look like corkscrews and either manually or electrically purport to clean your ear,” says Dr. Chandrasekhar. “These are not safe or indicated, in my opinion.” (Our list doesn’t include any of these as a result.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Schweitzer also recommends kits that can remove the wax without worsening the plug of wax (which can get inadvertently knotted into hair cells). “Professionals usually use a lighted loop tool to pull out a buildup after ‘irrigating’ with a sterile solution,” he says. Should you want to combine several techniques for a seamless removal, you can combine drops or a liquid solution like hydrogen peroxide — such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">QISXROVY Ear-Cleaning Kit</a> — to break up the hard wax, and then use a tool like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ototek Loop Ear Wax Removal Device</a> to scoop out the pieces.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Safety</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As our experts said, certain ear-cleaning solutions are safer than others, but at the end of the day, the less you do the better. If you have nothing on hand, your pinky finger will suffice, though Dr. Chandrasekhar says a washcloth is also “fine as it cannot go deeper than the meatus” (or the front opening of the ear canal).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have access to a proper ear-cleaning kit, we suggest avoiding electronic or corkscrew technology, whereas irrigation and manual kits are perfectly safe when used properly. The key is to irrigate slowly, rather than shooting a burst of water or solution in your ear. When using a manual kit, don’t stick the tool in too deep —&nbsp;stay near the opening of the ear canal. And if you’re reaching for hydrogen peroxide, the golden rule applies — no more than 10 drops.

As both of our experts have mentioned, the ear really will clean itself. But in certain cases, wax buildup can lead to partial hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and other concerning symptoms, so sometimes it’s necessary to help your ear with the cleaning process. “If you feel that wax is at the opening of the ear canal — also called the meatus — you can use your pinky finger to remove it,” says Dr. Chandrasekhar, who notes that this is only if your nails are cut short.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the leave-it-alone method and your finger, a washcloth is also advised. And to make the process even simpler (and frankly, more effective), we’ve provided eight cleaning kits that will unclog your ears with ease.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.92748091603053><p><span class=accordion__title>What happens if you don't clean your ears for years?</span></p><p>“Absolutely nothing,” says Dr. Chandrasekhar. Again, ears clean themselves. Unless you’re working with a hearing condition, need a hearing aid, or tend to produce a lot of wax, there’s not much maintenance required. That being said, should you want to ensure good ear hygiene, these cleaning kits create an easy way to regularly address wax buildup which can prevent you from getting the most out of listening devices like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>noise-canceling earbuds and headphones</a>.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.95767835550181><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you know if you have ear wax buildup?</span></p><p>If you see wax on your earbuds or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wired headphones</a>, then you might have buildup.
