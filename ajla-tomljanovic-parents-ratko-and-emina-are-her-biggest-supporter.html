Ratko Tomljanovic, who was a professional athlete, knew how hard it gets to play in hostile environments.</p><p>Ratko <a href=# rel=noopener>tried to calm his daughter</a>; he said, “Don’t tell me you are afraid of the crowd.”</p><p>“I played in some terrible places with 5,000 people booing and spitting, and one time the crowd came on the floor and there was a big fight. Don’t tell me it’s hard because some guy in the 35th row is yelling at you.”</p><p>After the father-daughter talk, Aija went to the court and blocked out all the noise. Getting over the anxiety and nervousness, she defeated the six-time US Open champion William, 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCtyaWYZqyformrrc2oraKbXaWus7HNrapmqpGpuLB5wKebZp2dnruiecCrnGaglad6o7XGoJysrF2owrG8zqurnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-montana-jordan-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Montana Jordan Dating Now</span></a>
