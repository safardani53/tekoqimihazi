And soon, he started working with cartoonist Lisa Hanawalt on the story of “somebody who’s had every opportunity for success but still can’t find a way to be happy.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Other animated TV shows also influenced ‘BoJack Horseman,’ Raphael said.</h2><p>In a 2018 feature in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Raphael listed BoJack Horseman’s 10 biggest influences from the world of animation.</p><p>The long-running Fox show <a href=#>The Simpsons</a> inspired Raphael with its humor and its heartbreaking humanity, for example. The 1988 film <a href=#>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a> showed that comedy could be “an incredible tool” and also “a danger,” he said. And the FX series Archer impressed Raphael with its “caustic style” and serialized storylines.</p><p>Even family-friendly fare like Pixar films made a mark on Raphael’s style. “With the <a href=#>Toy Story</a> movies, by knowing these characters, it becomes richer and richer with each movie,” he said. “That’s an exciting thing for me, to have my show and deepen it and deepen it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJunmpawrHnHqKmsnZ2Wu26uwKycnWWfow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-kerr-nude-in-rolling-stone.html><span>←</span><span>Nude in Rolling Stone Australia</span></a>
