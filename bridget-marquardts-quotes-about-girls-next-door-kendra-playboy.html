Marquardt, Madison and Wilkinson were already dating the Playboy founder when E! ordered a show about their lives at the mansion.
“They made it very clear to us that if we didn’t want to do it, there would be a million girls who would want to take our place,” Marquardt recalled on A&E’s Secrets of Playboy, which aired in 2022, about the origins of Girls Next Door."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He opens up the shower door like, ‘Why aren’t you signing this contract? I need you to sign this contract!’ I signed the contract, crying and soaking wet.”</p><p>Madison agreed that she signed the contract “under duress” after initially being hesitant because she didn’t want “a contract to be in a relationship’ with Hefner, who died in 2017 at age 91. While the three women went on to star on Girls Next Door for five seasons, Marquardt <a href=#>slammed the series when </a><a href=#>revisiting it for the “Girls Next Level” podcast with Madison.</a></p><p>“Holly warned me that the first three episodes were really hard to watch. And when she said that, I thought she just meant, like, kind of just getting used to watching them again and once you get past three episodes, you’re good. I just watched them not last night, but the night before. And I’m still traumatized. I’m sick to my stomach. I can’t sleep, I’ve been crying,” she said on the “Juicy Scoop With Heather McDonald” podcast in August 2022. “They just took that made it look like I was ridiculing everybody that came, that I was just this jealous bitch, that I was getting people drunk and sabotaging their pictorials.”</p><p>Marquardt added that “little things” with the editing bothered her, suggesting that she and Madison were “immediately made out to be bitches.”</p><p>The Holly’s Word alum added, “They never did that to Kendra. Ever.”</p><p>When it comes to her time with Hefner outside of the show, however, Marquardt is seemingly more positive than Madison.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Looking back on [it], my experiences with Hef and the mansion are pretty positive. I would say 98 percent of it is positive,” she told <strong>Heather McDonald</strong>, noting that A&E didn’t include her more <a href=#>positive experiences for Secrets of Playboy.</a> “There were a few stories that I had or things that I didn’t think were quite right or whatever and those are the only stories that they use and they use them to kind of back up Holly’s stories.”</p><p>Scroll through for more from Marquardt:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7O1w6CcrWWdlr%2BywcCrm62rXabCsMDErGSamp%2BqwW6zyKujrGWemsW1ecOopqtlm5q7pb7AZqelmamXvLp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-wilson-bethel-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Wilson Bethel Dating Now</span></a>
