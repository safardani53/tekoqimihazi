If a team can interpret what those signs mean, it can give them an advantage when their batter is at the plate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>, stealing signs isn’t prohibited in the MLB, but it is seen as bad etiquette. It is prohibited however to use electronic equipment to help steal signs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0miZmquVl66tuIyfmKdlpaiytHnMnp6aqJiku6Z506hkoZ2ToLmmeceorKysn6N6or%2FTq6asZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natanael-cano.html><span>←</span><span>Natanael Cano</span></a>
