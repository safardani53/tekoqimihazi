To summarize, not good.</p><p>Jeymi has avoided weighing in on the show itself. Until now — when she could not help but blurt out her shock to followers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“This is my face watching the show right now,” Jeymi Noguera announced to her fans and followers on Sunday night.</p><p>Her short Instagram video did not go into explicit detail on her reaction. That, of course, is the purview of the Tell All, and Jeymi is under contract.</p><p>However, she did include a caption that expanded a little bit more on her feelings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Like every Sunday I ask your opinion… what do you think of this episode?” Jeymi asked.</p><p>“I never give an opinion,” she acknowledged. “But today I am in shock.”</p><p>Considering the contents of the episode itself, we can certainly understand why.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When we saw Kris Foster on Season 4, Episode 12 of 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way, she was sitting out in the yard with her mother.</p><p>At this point, Kris’ “two week” trip to Alabama (though that time frame was always optimistic) had expanded into five months.</p><p>Yes, there were practical concerns. Kris had to fix things with the bank and refill her narcolepsy meds. And she could also actually work in Alabama.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kris’ mom knows that her daughter’s marriage is having issues. She knows Kris’s side of things … and she also knows her daughter.</p><p>As such, she remarked that she was unsure if two “drama queens” could really be happy while married to one another.</p><p>Kris actually agreed. Which … does not bode well for someone who is only half a year into her marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So, here is how Kris was seeing things in the moment. In her mind, she was shouldering all of the financial burdens for her and for Jeymi.</p><p>The two had worked out a financial plan. Since then, Jeymi had gotten a more expensive apartment than they had discussed, and she had quit her job (with Kris’ blessing) but had not, in five months, found a new one.</p><p>Meanwhile, she also clearly resented Kris for spending this time in Alabama, even though Kris can actually work in the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To Kris, all of this feels unfair — and makes her feel like Jeymi doesn’t appreciate her.</p><p>Case in point: she shared that she had sent $1,000 to Jeymi recently, only for Jeymi to express anger.</p><p>Why? Because it would (obviously) not cover all of the bills for the month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>At this point, Kris’ mother remarked on what this relationship is looking like to her.</p><p>She likened Jeymi to a “kept woman,” a reference to someone with a lover for whom they provide financially.</p><p>That is the older euphemism. A more current one is “sugar baby,” and Kris’ mother did drop the “sugar mama” label in reference to Kris’ apparent role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, Jeymi was of course tearfully hoping for Kris to return to Colombia. So, in that regard, it’s truly not a “sugar” relationship … even if it might look like one on paper. At least, on a financial spreadsheet.</p><p>But Kris was clearly tired of Jeymi not having her own job.</p><p>And so she said that “actions speak louder than words,” and so she wanted to see some action from Jeymi very soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Meanwhile, what was Jeymi’s side of things?</p><p>Well, you know how Kris has been feeling underappreciated? Jeymi was feeling abandoned.</p><p>Her wife had left for Alabama for a two-week (or so) trip, and had been gone for five months. This marriage hadn’t felt like a marriage for a lot of the time since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jeymi met up with her friend, Alex. She had not really spoken to him about any of this … because she felt embarrassed.</p><p>(To be fair, he did straight up-say “told you so” after she brought him up to speed. And, to be fair, he did absolutely tell her so)</p><p>In his mind, Kris’ prior ghosting of Jeymi was just a prelude to this. And it’s very sad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jeymi acknowledged that she understood that Kris had to work, and that she cannot in Colombia.</p><p>But she noted that they had made plans to open a business together.</p><p>That way, they could both generate income together. Is that a great plan or a pipe dream? We honestly do not know. We’re not overly familiar with the viability of American-Venzuelan food trucks in Bogota.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And, for the record, Jeymi hadn’t given up on finding a job.</p><p>It might feel that way to Kris. A five-month job search isn’t impossible, but it’s rare. (We wish that it were rarer! No one should have to live on uncertainty for that long!)</p><p>Jeymi noted that a lot of businesses have no apparent interest in hiring someone of Venezuelan descent. American racists and xenophobes do not have a monopoly on bigotry. It happens in other countries, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jeymi told Alex that she had contributed to their expenses — quitting her job (with Kris’ blessing) and picking a more expensive apartment.</p><p>Kris being in Alabama has not helped them resolve any of their differences, however.</p><p>In fact, she felt like she couldn’t really speak to Kris. Either Kris was unavailable, or they would argue when they actually spoke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Alex told her very directly that he would have already ended things in her shoes.</p><p>But she wanted to give Kris a chance to talk things out. She wanted to understand. And the two of them really love one another.</p><p>It will be interesting to hear if watching this season has impacted (or will impact) their marriage.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WBcLbEsqSiZZ6ktLax0ZpkmpydnsG0edKhppyjXam8boWPZpuasV2brq%2B%2FjKitnqpdoL%2Bqv4yvnKurmaS7brvFZpyvnZ6pwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-faye-grant-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Faye Grant Dating Now</span></a>
