In the last six weeks he has been on two luxurious vacations, Iceland & the four seasons in Punta Mita. He resides in a $2 million estate paid by his mother-in-law, Candy Spelling, and has no impetus to work. He owes over $100,000 moving forward, and I believe he has no intention of paying,” Estace writes in the documents filed on October 10. “He bounces my son’s university rent/tuition and is delinquent in paying therapist bills, while he shops visibly and throws lavish parties for his other five children.”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"></p><p>McDermott’s wife, <b><a href=#>Tori Spelling</a></b>, has posted about their family’s recent getaways on social media. Alongside one photo from their Iceland trip, Spelling <a href=#>wrote </a>on Instagram on September 21: Never thought in my wildest dreams I’d be visiting one of the largest glacier caves in Iceland ❄️ and then snowmobiling across it. But I did it all today w/my hubby.”</p><p>Eustace, 55, and McDermott married in 1993 and divorced in 2006 after McDermott began an affair with Spelling.</p><p><a href=#>Eustace challenged McDermott in court</a> in March 2017 after filing a contempt of court charge against him for allegedly not paying spousal support payments. The author claimed that McDermott owed her “over $100,000. He just stopped paying two years ago for our original support, and he didn’t pay child support.”</p><p>The former spouses were able to come to an agreement in March. “I filed the paperwork myself for the contempt of court,” Eustace told <i>Us </i>after representing herself in court. “The judge was very clear that it’s a criminal charge; contempt of court is jail time.”</p><p>Adding that she and McDermott were able to agree on a payment plan outside of the courtroom, Eustace explained: “I think that it’s an absolute win.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported</a>, McDemott’s financial issues with Spelling have directly impacted the teenager. “Dean owes about $800 for Jack’s apartment,” a source told Us in September, noting that as Eustace prepared to take her ex to court for the second time, “he keeps telling her to give him more time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZGjeq6vw56ppqekqcBusddmrqKelWKwra3IpqpmoJViwLW7z6mcnWWglsaqusZmmqGhnJl6tMHPqaarrF2sgnGFkHJoaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chase-stokes-stranger-things-audition-steve-video.html><span>←</span><span>Chase Stokes Reveals He Auditioned To Play Steve On Stranger Things Hollywood Life</span></a>
