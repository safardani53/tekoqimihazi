Unfortunately, we could not find further information regarding this matter.</p><p>Besides that, he was fond of soccer from a young age and possessed great skills. So, easily, a professional soccer career was the right and evident path for him.&nbsp;</p><p>What we know is that Pineda played for Queretaro’s youth team, with whom he would eventually make his professional debut.</p><p>During his time with the club, Orbelin performed quite brilliantly in every age group. Thus, the Mexican international was called up to the senior team at the age of just 17.</p><h2>Orbelin Pineda | Football Career</h2><p>Pineda began his foray into the professional world with his boyhood club, Queretaro.</p><p>To explain, the 1.73 m midfielders made his debut coming on as a substitute in the 70th minute against Ascenso MX on 21 January 2014. Although his club lost the game 1-0, Orbelin showed flashes of brilliance that impressed the coaching staff.</p><p>Furthermore, Pineda’s second season with Queretaro turned out to be his breakthrough season. To illustrate, the 18-year-old managed to appear 41 times and scored six goals and provided one assist.</p><p>After that, the Mexican international stayed with the club for another year before moving to one of the bigger clubs of Liga MX, Guadalajara.</p><p>Moving on, Guadalajara signed Orbelin on 2 December 2015 for an undisclosed fee. Likewise, the decision to move to his new club was relatively easy as they were one of the four most prominent clubs in Mexico.</p><p>Subsequently, the Mexico City native spent four years with Guadalajara, during which he won the Liga MX once during the 2016-17 season. Although the 25-year-old midfielder did not manage to win more trophies, it was not due to his lack of effort or ability.</p><p>As a result, Oberlin decided to move to Cruz Azul in the hopes of winning more trophies. By the time Pineda finished his time with Guadalajara, he had appeared in 125 matches scoring 10 goals along the way.</p><p>Soon after, a <strong>$13 deal</strong> was struck between the two clubs in December 2018. Subsequently, the Mexican international made his debut against Puebla in a 1-1 draw.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Orbelin-Pineda-Playing-In-The-Field.-Source-Pinterest.jpg><p>After that, Cruz reached the final of the 2018-19 Torneo Apertura but unfortunately lost the match 2-0 against one of the most well-known clubs in the world, Club America.</p><p>Nonetheless, except in the final, Cruz and Pineda held their head high as they performed outstandingly throughout the tournament.</p><p>On the contrary, the 2019-20 Torneo Apertura has been dismal for Cruz Azul as they could not qualify for the playoffs. Nevertheless, with Liguilla Apertura still left to play, we have full confidence that the 27-year-old can win the second league title of his career.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>The 27-year-old midfielder made his international debut against Honduras during a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match. Moreover, the game took place on 6 September 2016 and finished in a 0-0 draw.</p><p>Later on, Pineda scored his first goal for Mexico against El Salvador on 9 July 2017. To further emphasize, the match took place in the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup group stage, which made the goal even better.</p><p>However, Orbelin’s best moment with the Mexican national team has to be winning the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p><p>In doing so, the Mexico City native won his first international trophy.</p><p>Currently, Pineda has made 21 appearances for the El Tri, scoring one goal and assisting a further two times. But, he has not been able to cement a starting place on the Mexican side.</p><p>Nevertheless, looking at his young age and unbridled potential, we believe that Oberlin can become a permanent fixture in the El Tri in the coming days.</p><h2>Qatar 2022 World Cup</h2><p>AEK Athens called Orbelin for World Cup Qatar 2022.</p><p>Orbelin Pineda was honored by AEK Athens via its social media channels for being selected by the Mexican National Team to compete in the World Cup in Qatar.</p><p>Though he is selected for the squad, the possibility of him being included in playing eleven is slim.</p><p dir=ltr lang=el><a href=#>@orbelin90</a> , συγχαρητήρια και καλή επιτυχία! <a href=#>#aekfc</a> <a href=#>#FIFAWorldCup</a> <a href=#>#Qatar2022</a> <a href=#>#WCQ</a> <a href=#>#Pineda_13</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9i9hm0BE2x</a></p><p>— AEK F.C.

Although he&nbsp;is still quite young, he started playing professionally at the age of 17.</p><p>Moving on, Pineda stands at 1.69 meters, which is quite small for a soccer player. However, his short height also means a lower center of gravity.</p><p>Consequently, he can easily glide past players using his array of tricks along with being able to blitz past opponents due to his lightning pace.</p><p>Furthermore, the Mexican international plays typically as an advanced midfielder of the two in a 4-2-3-1 formation, perfectly fitting his game. Therefore, Orbelin has become one of the more important players in the Cruz Azul squad.</p><h2>Orbelin Pineda | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2022, Pineda has a net worth of <strong>$3 – $10 million, </strong>mainly through his playing career as a professional soccer player.
