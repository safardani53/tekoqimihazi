Part of me feels sadden that human life is going to be destroyed.But let's not get it twisted. Mable Scruggs, Fred Jones, Mary Bratcher are the real victims here.</p><p>"Truthfully me, my brother and my sister all lost the place we called home. A piece of all of us died on February 13, 1994."</p><h2>'A TINY PIECE OF KARMA'</h2><p>Lorrie called a tumor which in 2008 saw up to 20 per cent of Johnson's brain tissue removed "karma" and added: "Well, he beat my mother so badly she was missing part of her frontal lobe.</p><p>"I guess that tumor was a tiny piece of Karma."</p><p>Johnson was convicted of killing Bratcher, 46, as well as her colleagues Mable Scruggs, 57, and Fred Jones, 58, at Casey’s General Store in Columbia in February 1994.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He had wanted money to buy drugs, authorities said.</p><p>Lorrie added: "Since no one wants to talk about the real victims in this.</p><p>"Her name was Mary Bratcher. It was my mother. She was a good person. She was all I had. She was pure joy. And you took her from me.</p><p>"He: 1, planned a robbery he visited the store seven times that day. Casing the joint. Asking how many people would be working. Getting two young men to get him a gun.</p><p>"2, He executed the robbery. While in the commission of a crime he beat 3 people to death with a hammer.</p><p>"He tried to hide and burn all the incriminating evidence.</p><p>"Went shopping for valentines gifts the next day at the mall. After being high all night buying crack with the money from the robbery."</p><h2>POPE APPEALS FOR CLEMENCY</h2><p>Johnson's execution would be the first execution in Missouri since convicted killer Walter Barton was put to death in May 2020.</p><p>His attorney Kansas City public defender Jeremy Weis had argued&nbsp;Johnson “meets all statutory and clinical definitions” of intellectual disability and has an IQ that in various tests has ranged from 67 to 77.</p><p>Weis said Johnson also was born with fetal alcohol syndrom.</p><p>The Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits executing intellectually disabled people.</p><p>Pope Francis and Missouri lawmakers Cori Bush and Emanuel Cleaver II are among those who requested clemency.</p><p>But that was denied by Republican Gov. Michael Parson on Monday.</p><h2>CLAW HAMMER DEATH</h2><p>All three workers were beaten to death with a claw hammer.</p><p>Bratcher also was stabbed at least 10 times with a screwdriver and Jones was shot in the face. The bodies were hid in a cooler.</p><p>Johnson was arrested after police found a bank bag, stolen money and store receipts at his home.</p><p>He had previously asked that his execution be carried out by firing squad.</p><p>His lawyers argued that Missouri’s lethal injection drug, pentobarbital, could trigger seizures.</p><p>But Missouri law does not authorize execution by firing squad and the U.S. Supreme Court in May refused to consider Johnson’s appeal.</p><h2>DEATH SENTENCE</h2><p>The Missouri Supreme Court also declined to halt the execution based on concerns about the drug.</p><p>Johnson has been sentenced to death three times.</p><p>He was already on death row in 2001 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that executing the mentally ill was unconstitutionally cruel and a new sentencing hearing was ordered.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Johnson was again sentenced to death in 2003. The Missouri Supreme Court tossed that sentence, too.</p><p>In 2006, Johnson was sentenced to death again. His team filed a last minute appeal to the Supreme Court on Monday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000684783894.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoN0f5Zsa3Fnlae7pr%2FTZqOenV2fvKm60qilZq6ZmMGquYyer56bpam2sLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2017-golden-globes-mandy-m-kristen-b-wear-low-necklines-w459675.html><span>←</span><span>2017 Golden Globes: Mandy M., Kristen B.
