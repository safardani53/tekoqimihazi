Grab a book or the remote, because your lounging space is about to get a whole lot more toasty with our favorite electric blankets. These aren’t your grandmother’s heated blankets, though. Today’s electric blankets are designed to fit into a variety of home aesthetics, and PEOPLE is here to guide you on what to look for when making your choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“There are a few ways to identify a high-quality heated blanket," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Laurie March</a>, a project manager, remodeling pro, and digital host for HGTV, tells PEOPLE. "Look for a UL certification and a warranty on the product for at least one year. Heated blankets can come in an array of soft synthetic fabrics, as well as natural fibers, so a comfortable texture and feel can be found for just about everyone."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone but your four-legged friends, that is. “Sadly, experts advise that pets should be kept off your bed when your heated blanket is in use, so that they don’t damage the coils,” adds March. Humans, however, can enjoy all the benefits of electric blankets, both in keeping warm, and in keeping costs down as you may be able to set your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>smart thermostat</a> to a lower nighttime temperature.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">March also suggests investing in a blanket with an automatic shut-off or a timer feature. “Use the automatic shut-off setting or timer on your heated blanket to defend against chilly nights and high energy bills,” adds March. “Newer electric blankets heat up in minutes, and for fire safety, should not be used all night.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the best electric blankets, tested by PEOPLE.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-shavel-home-products-micro-flannel-heated-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shavel Home Products Micro Flannel Heated Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Shavel Micro Flannel Sherpa Electric Blanket displayed on a solid background" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MSn7K_rALbwvpSUA_kptq53YLW8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shavel-thermee-micro-flannel-electric-blanket-cadda29232cf4371949333db144ee326.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>Took just five minutes to warm up to a cozy temperature without us feeling overheated</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Two-zone heating for queen and king sizes; ideal if you sleep with a partner</p></li><li readability=1><p>Material is soft, has a nice weight, and doesn't shed</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Machine washable and easy to spot clean if you spill food or drink on it</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a beautiful, effective electric blanket that kept us cozy and calm within just five minutes of use. It warmed quickly without overheating, and combined with the luxurious weight, we almost fell asleep while resting under this electric blanket. The materials are high quality — quilted stitching offers that durable feel, and the addition of the sherpa adds so much softness (without leaving any of those annoying fuzzies behind). We could not feel any of the wires inside, and the cords are minimal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the king size version (the one we tested), as well as the queen size, there are two controllers included — so if you sleep with a partner, each person can attain their desired temperature. In our spilled coffee spot treatment test, we were able to easily remove most of the stain, though the flannel side might take an extra spot cleaning. Given the quality and durability of this blanket, we were pleasantly surprised by the price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside was the lack of programming capabilities — we couldn’t find any instructions on how to program beyond the auto shut-off feature. That aside, we think this is a cozy, comfortable, and durable electric blanket that offers the user total control over the heat settings and provides important safety features.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>Beyond our lab tests, we put this electric blanket to use in a tester’s home for six months to see how well it performed over time. Our tester loved snuggling under this blanket. It’s super soft and being a king size, very spacious to wrap up in. They did wish the cords were spaced out a little more because they tended to get twisted up in one another. That said it, heats up quickly and stays warm for a while (with an auto shut-off safety feature). On laundry day, just remove the cords and wash it on a gentle cycle before tumble drying on low. The quality has remained consistent during use, and our tester said it’s the best heated blanket they’ve ever had.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings: </strong>10 | <strong>Auto shut-off:</strong> Yes, up to 12 hours | <strong>Material: </strong>100% polyester cover | <strong>Machine wash:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 100 x 90 inches (king); 90 x 84 inches (queen) | <strong>Weight:</strong> 8 lbs. | <strong>ETL certified:</strong> Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Shavel Micro Flannel Sherpa Electric Blanket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/U1Jx8EhXIJ17oEJhFQoVUaQFEuw=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/electric-blankets-test-micro-flannel-reverse-sherpa-heated-bed-bath-beyond-dburreson-143-9ce5ed7251a44ce4955317c5702908f0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4380 data-sizes=750px alt="Shavel Micro Flannel Sherpa Electric Blanket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/eLtkvF3Gs9R1sK5vsnc5CwOAYbg=/fit-in/1500x4380/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/electric-blankets-test-micro-flannel-reverse-sherpa-heated-bed-bath-beyond-dburreson-171-d3c7b5c18a48497593f30ccc4335036a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-curecure-heated-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CureCure Heated Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon CureCure Heated Throw Blanket folded and displayed on a solid white background" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qsPsgJlyWRtGRKd8m5K_Zt1hMaU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CureCure-Heated-Blanket-bbed98e846b44ef189a77e5a4feb3d83.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Undetectable wires evenly distribute heat throughout</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We found the controller to be very user-friendly</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Features a six-hour automatic shut-off</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Needs to soak before machine washing, making cleaning a bit more complicated</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Smaller in size compared to other blankets we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s a simple, no-frills product that does what it promises and does it well — the epitome of a great budget choice. The velour fabric is soft (as is the sherpa underside) and the wires are not particularly evident while in use. The controller is very easy to use and the wires are also well-distributed, which makes the blanket more comfortable and provides good, thoroughly distributed heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This blanket features a six-hour shut-off and did well in our spot-cleaning test. Though we wish the throw was longer, we would recommend it to those who want a basic heated throw. It would be nice if the cleaning instructions were easier, too — they include pre-soaking before putting in the washing machine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>This electric blanket was another tester favorite. Our tester used it for six months at home and said they frequently came home to their dog snuggled under it while it was off (to echo our expert, pets shouldn’t lie on them when heated). The cord is quite versatile: Its length allows you to plug it in while sitting in a variety of places, whether on the couch, a chair, or even in bed. The controller is also user-friendly, and the blanket heats up quickly (with an auto-shut off function). Over the course of our test period, there was also no damage despite many washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings:</strong> 4 | <strong>Auto shut-off:</strong> Yes, after 6 hours | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester and cotton | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 50 x 60 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.48 lbs. | <strong>ETL certified:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-camping-eddie-bauer-portable-heated-throw-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Camping</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eddie Bauer Portable Heated Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eddie Bauer Portable Heated Throw Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/C7zI-1CcBiZBTsVLZqpiRapvFAQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eddie-bauer-portable-heated-electric-blanket-a1dcafa2613c4565a4f865c749c0339b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>1.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Big enough to use outdoors for camping or sporting events</p></li><li readability=-1><p>One side of the fabric is water-resistant</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Relatively affordable compared to other electric blankets we tested</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>We were able to feel the wires during use (although the blanket still remained flexible)</p></li><li readability=0><p>Did not perform properly after machine washing, so we would only suggest spot cleaning</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for extra warmth while camping or watching sports outdoors this fall and winter, look no further than Eddie Bauer’s portable electric throw. A pocket for the battery with a velcro closure means you can take this blanket with you, and the fabric itself is weather-resistant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were able to feel the wires, but it did not detract from the blanket’s flexibility. It’s an easy size to manage on the go, even with the weight of the battery, and provides four to six hours of heat and three heat settings. It warmed immediately, and the heat is focused in the hand pouch area which is ideal for camping, sporting events and more. This blanket did not work well after machine-washing it, so we would only recommend spot-cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester and nylon | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 50 x 40 inches | <strong>Weight</strong>: 3.03 lbs. |<strong> Machine wash:</strong> No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Eddie Bauer Portable Heated Electric Throw Blanket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/25xuTRH-VO3DMJBhDjW6m7pEbxQ=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/electric-blankets-test-eddie-bauer-portable-heated-throw-amazon-dburreson-218-f9e7795182e9479a85b21baf548a6e38.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2608 data-sizes=750px alt="Eddie Bauer Portable Heated Throw Blanket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mQx6qlzl23cb6oJNL5Hd0kvHeWg=/fit-in/1500x2608/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/electric-blankets-test-eddie-bauer-portable-heated-throw-amazon-dburreson-222-1784e7533ea749518719aa6eadfee640.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flannel-shavel-micro-flannel-quilted-electric-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Flannel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shavel Micro Flannel Electric Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shavel Micro Flannel Quilted Electric Blanket folded and displayed over a solid white backdrop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zitjHJcmbGKQ5QDFpw9nSQQx7pU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shavel-micro-flannel-high-quality-durable-heating-technology-luxuriously-soft--warm-electric-blanket-beb72b083e744fc991b361216ef80cc5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Intuitive controls make this blanket easy to use and adjust</p></li><li readability=-1><p>17-foot-long cord provides flexibility in where you use this blanket</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Two-zone heating is ideal if you sleep with a partner</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can adjust the temperature and timer to your heart’s content with this blanket, designed with a mainly flannel feel and a silky border. The blanket heated up as expected, and the controls were intuitive to use, with up and down arrow buttons for the temperature and timer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We started with the blanket at room-temperature 70 degrees. On a low setting, we measured the blanket at 76 degrees, and on a high setting, 81 degrees. The wires (which are not overly obvious but still noticeable) were evenly spaced throughout the blanket, which also has dual settings so two people can use at once. The flannel feels soft, and would be a great pairing to your seasonal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flannel sheets</a> and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cozy comforter</a>. Overall, this blanket is easy to use and effective, if a bit pricey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>Our tester never experienced any issues with the blanket in the six months they tested it at home. The tester and their partner appreciated the dual controls and how well the blanket fit their king-sized bed. Plus the material was a good texture (soft and not too scratchy), the cord was long enough to reach the closest plug, and the controls were user-friendly. When in use, the electric blanket heated up quickly, maintained a consistent temperature, and automatically shut-off after extended use. For the best experience, we suggest turning the blanket on while you’re doing your skincare routine or getting ready for bed so you can immediately feel the warmth once it's time to go to sleep.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings:</strong> 8 | <strong>Auto shut-off: </strong>Yes, after 10 hours | <strong>Programmable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Quilted micro flannel (polyester) | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 90 x 72 inches | <strong>Cord length: </strong>17 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>8 lbs. | <strong>Machine wash: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-thin-wires-perfect-fit-softheat-luxury-fleece-electric-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Thin Wires</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Perfect Fit SoftHeat Electric Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon SoftHeat by Perfect Fit Luxury Fleece Electric Heated Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/olp6G4Fc_11E_A9UaYO36MTONFM=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SoftHeat-by-Perfect-Fit-Luxury-Fleece-Electric-Heated-Blanket-ecb83924b91a4bcea47fdf2747788aaa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Wires are not noticeable or crinkly when shifting under the blanket</p></li><li readability=-1><p>All programmed settings are user-friendly</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Built to last with machine-washable fabric and a 5-year warranty</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Does not get as warm as some of the other models we tested</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Fabric slightly matted after spot-cleaning</p></li><li readability=1><p>A bit heavy, but if you like weighted blankets, it’s not necessarily a con</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re interested in sleeping with an electric blanket that won’t take over the bed or couch, the Perfect Fit SoftHeat Luxury blanket is a contender. With a 10-hour shut-off and a non-bulky feel, it’s a nice addition to a bed if you run cold at night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did not notice discernible wires on this blanket, nor did the insides produce any crinkling sound. It was just the right feel and weight as an addition to your other bedding, too. We found this blanket to get comfortably warm, but less so than others we tested — probably not the best choice for truly frigid nights.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spot cleaning was successful, though the fabric did get a bit matted in the process. We were able to fluff it back up as it dried after spot cleaning. This electric blanket would be good for someone who wants light warmth and a no-fuss setup. It’s a good value and would make a nice gift for a relative or friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>After using this blanket for six months, our tester still appreciates its performance. It heats up quickly without getting too hot, and provides a cozy experience with a soft fleece material. We found it can feel heavy at times, which could be good or bad depending on if you like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>weighted blankets</a>.

The wires are so discreet that this could even pass as a regular blanket. The dual controls (on the larger sizes) are well-designed, too: The control panel is angled upward, which makes it easier to see. The cords are also flatter than some others we tested, which makes them easy to maneuver, and less likely to get tangled.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The thin, plush fabric has a very soft, warm, and luxurious feel, and you have a lot of control when it comes to warmth with a variety of settings. In our tests, the temperature went up 10 degrees on the high setting, and four degrees on the low setting. You can also program the shut-off time, anywhere from 30 minutes to 12 hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After washing, the blanket still looked and felt good, and performed to the level of its original capabilities. We found it to be an overall solid value, though we do wish the controller had a backlit screen for better visibility at night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>After our two-month testing period, we still appreciated the plushness this blanket offered. The dual controls are really designed for two-person use, so if you’re one person using the blanket, having to set both controls could be a setback; otherwise, it’s a neat feature. The auto-shut off function kicks on after 10 hours, so you can sleep with this blanket and be warm all night (the lowest warmth setting was our tester’s most-used, except on especially cold nights).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings: </strong>10 |<strong> Auto shut-off:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material: </strong>Faux sherpa polyester | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 77 x 84 inches (full) | <strong>Cord length:</strong> 19 inches | <strong>Machine wash:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-foot-pockets-degrees-of-comfort-micro-plush-heated-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Foot Pockets</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Degrees of Comfort Micro-Plush Heated Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon A Degrees of Comfort Micro-Plush Heated Blanket With Foot Pocket folded and displayed on a solid white background" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rcIGd9YPJICk3pq90tM38NhKM9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/a-degrees-of-comfort-micro-plush-heated-blanket-with-foot-pocket-folded-and-displayed-on-a-solid-white-background-bf65689f9255416e92420d1dfcacd464.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Heats up quickly; warmed up 14 degrees in just 15 minutes</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Will last you a while as it’s machine washable and has a 5-year warranty</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Foot pocket to keep your toes warm (so they won’t stick out as often happens with blankets)</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Only has three temperature settings</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Plug feels large given the size of the blanket</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We found loose threads around the plug</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re coming inside on a rainy day and want to get warm fast, this blanket is a great choice. We loved how fast it warmed up, and on the high setting, it warmed to a toasty 82 degrees. The size makes this electric blanket a good choice as a throw blanket for the couch, and the fabric is rather thin but soft. It also has a heated foot pocket so your toes won’t stick out from under the blanket (say less).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, some loose threads around the plug (and the disproportionately large size of the plug itself) were the drawbacks for us on this one. It wasn’t the easiest to unplug, either. There are just three temperature settings on this model — low, medium, and high. On the high setting, the blanket warmed up 14 degrees from its starting temperature in our test, and in just 15 minutes. Overall, we appreciated the soft feel and quick heat time of this electric blanket.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>This blanket easily covered two people sitting on the couch. We were surprised with how well the blanket performed —&nbsp;with its quick heat-up time, comfortable material, and snug foot pocket to keep toes from being exposed. In general, it was intuitive to use, but we wished it had a longer shut-off time and that the cord wasn’t as bulky. Overall, we enjoyed using this blanket for over the course of six months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Auto shut-off: </strong>Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.72 lbs. | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 50 x 62 inches | <strong>Cord length:</strong> 6 feet | <strong>Warranty:</strong> 5 years | <strong>Machine wash: </strong>Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-16 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Degrees of Comfort Micro-Plush Heated Blanket With Foot Pocket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JT1tw0DtzTkKVPhYDyJaPobaPI0=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/electric-blankets-test-degrees-comfort-micro-plush-heated-foot-pocket-amazon-dburreson-230-d45ae58d7a86472689e75bdafb305d4b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Micro-Plush Heated Blanket with Foot Pocket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Vl3henVUQsFjRbBpctOXix60vA4=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/electric-blankets-test-degrees-comfort-micro-plush-heated-foot-pocket-amazon-dburreson-214-e7cfb0661dd9498a8ff0db0b3ca63dd4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-faux-fur-beautyrest-heated-faux-fur-wrap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Faux Fur</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BeautyRest Heated Faux Fur Wrap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Simmons BeautyRest Heated Faux Fur Wrap" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rWN9-ukAyNNhXsySU0-Hw4BDa9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Beautyrest-Heated-Faux-Fur-Wrap--232b10ad1970485e9883afb3cd79981c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pottery Barn</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heat</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>Large enough to completely wrap up in or spread out across a couch or bed</p></li><li readability=1><p>Wires are barely noticeable, so it feels like you’re under a regular blanket (that’s just really warm)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Faux fur is extremely soft and perfect to cozy up in</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Heats up quickly (around 21 degrees in just a few minutes)</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This plush faux fur electric blanket from Beautyrest made a moment of rest that much more peaceful for our team. It’s so large we’re calling it a wrap blanket, as you can lounge in your favorite chair or on the couch and be enveloped (literally) by warmth. We barely noticed the heat wires, and while there is technically only one correct way to wear the wrap (which is comfier than even your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite robe</a>), both sides are equally soft and comfortable. You’ll immediately feel how cozy the faux fur material is when snuggling under this blanket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the blanket heated up quickly, and jumped a staggering 21 degrees in temperature, it didn’t feel that hot for more than 10 minutes or so (almost like a heating pad, where you feel the intensity of the heat at first and then it sort of fades the longer you have it on your body). Being a fur-like material, it will absorb water more often than it repels, but this isn’t a dealbreaker for us considering there are few cozy blankets that are actually water-resistant. A word of caution when making your morning coffee or winding down with a glass of wine: We spilled coffee on it, and it left a stain even after cleaning.

The inside of this throw is a fluffy sherpa fabric, and the outside is a soft, velour type. A light-up screen makes it easy to adjust the temperature and heating time. The highest setting was quite warm, but with a wide range of 10 heat settings, there’s an option for everyone. The 11-degree change in our test felt like a huge jump in temperature. There was definitely a noticeable shift, but it was nice and cozy once heated. The cord is a generous length, and the auto shut-off kicks in at four hours.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the wires inside the blanket were silent (no crinkling here), they were noticeable. Still, it does not diminish the soft, delicate feel, which was our favorite thing about this particular model. The downsides? A wet rag didn’t tackle the stain well in our spot testing. And it’s unclear whether the blanket will feel the same after machine washing. We’d recommend it as a smaller throw to use while relaxing, but not for sleeping due to the smaller size and auto shut-off time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat settings: </strong>10 | <strong>Auto shut-off:</strong> Yes, after 4 hours | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 60 x 50 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>3.74 lbs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-an-electric-blanket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying an Electric Blanket</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Controls</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Make sure the heating control is easy to read and easy to operate,” Deanna Hodges, the CEO of H2 Home Collection and Hodges International, tells PEOPLE Tested. “Look for a blanket with an auto shut-off and a timer.

Check the packaging and the cord for UL certification or ETL certification, as they are often printed on the item itself, and not necessarily in the online description.

The size of the blanket is often a key factor in pricing, as you can typically buy a twin, queen, or king, and often a throw size, too. If you plan to use an electric blanket on your bed, don’t skimp on the size — you’ll regret not having more surface area. But if you’re buying one to warm up a couch for cozy nights, get the best quality you can afford in a throw size.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Two-Zone Heating — or a Spare</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you are part of a couple, consider a blanket with two controls and two zones," Hodges says.
