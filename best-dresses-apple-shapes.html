Apple and pear shapes may seem similar, but there are a few key differences.</p><p>Apple shapes will tend to carry their weight around their middle, with broad shoulders and a big bust, but in contrast, their arms and legs will be slender.</p><p>Pear shapes hold more weight at their hips instead of the waist and tend to be smaller up top.</p><h2>Can apple shapes wear jumpsuits?</h2><p>Yes, absolutely! The key to dressing for all shapes is if it makes you feel amazing: wear it. For a more defined waistline, try a jumpsuit that nips in at the waist rather than drapes over it.</p><h2>Are wrap dresses good for apple shapes?</h2><p>Apple shapes love a defined waist, and a wrap dress is a perfect way to flatter your figure.</p><p>So, if you're looking to flaunt your shape and feel fabulous, check out our selection above, as we've put together the ONLY list of dresses you'll need to own your apple shape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFuYmd%2FeoWOm5ysrF2Zv6a%2F0p6qZpmgpbmmedKhmKmdo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-shaun-mcbride-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Shaun McBride Dating Now</span></a>
