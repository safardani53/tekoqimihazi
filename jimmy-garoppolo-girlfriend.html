Specifically, people are curious if Jimmy has a girlfriend! So, we dug into his current love life and dating history and found out which woman he's recently been linked to.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Jimmy Garoppolo have a girlfriend?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/KnO_D1y2A/200x200/headshot-1564501435809.PNG><p>It's hard to tell from Jimmy's Instagram whether or not he has a girlfriend since it's all football and family photos. If he does, he's very good at keeping it super private and doesn't mind keeping his fans guessing. But that hasn't stopped us from doing some digging. While we can't confirm, sources say Jimmy is now being linked to a woman named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giuliana Milan</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At the end of September 2023, Giuliana posted a photo of her and a friend in her Instagram Stories wearing Garoppolo jerseys. The text overlay read, "We are #10 all day! Battle of the bay??,” followed by a few red and yellow hearts. Either Giuliana has her eyes set on the prize (or is merely a fan) or the two have a secret relationship that we don't yet know about.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a previous sit-down, Jimmy actually revealed that he doesn't like flaunting his personal life and enjoys being private. “I’ve never been very big on being really public with things — even social media,” he explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SF Gate</a>. "I’m not out there a ton. But my life is looked at differently. I’m under a microscope. It’s like [head coach] Kyle [Shanahan] said: 'It is a good learning experience. I just have to take it in stride.'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But even though he's allegedly single right now, there have been some speculations about Jimmy's love life in the past (which is probably why he's decided to keep it on the hush-hush now.</p><p>At one point, he was associated with model Alexandra King after being spotted with her in Disneyland. But when he tore his ACL in what ended up being a 2018 season-ending injury, she took to Instagram to throw shade at the NFL star by writing the word "karma" on the social media platform. Ouch!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He has also been linked to porn star Kiara Mia. The public even blamed her for being bad luck since Jimmy was injured after being seen with her.</p><p>"I'm impressed that people look at me as a God," Kiara told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> of how she was flattered that people thought she was that powerful. "Like, only God has the power to, like, control someone's journey in life. So, I'm flattered people think I have that much power in my life to control somebody's life!"</p><p>While Jimmy has chosen to keep his romantic life private, not everyone in the NFL has followed suit. Specifically, people like <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a>, who's all over Instagram with his wife <a href=#>Brittany Matthews</a>. Not only does he post with or about her every chance he gets, but she returns the favor by gushing over him on her account as well.</p><p>We can't blame Jimmy for wanting a private love life, but if he needs a girlfriend and someone to cheer him on at his games, we're available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auudhmnpqqn6W9sLjOZp6iqpybv6qxzZ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-holi-powder-made-of.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Holi Powder Made Of?
