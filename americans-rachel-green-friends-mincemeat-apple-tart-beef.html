As Rachel Green knows all too well, you're not supposed to put beef in a sweet dessert. As Judy Geller would say, it does not taste good.
But social media users were confused today, when they stumbled upon a recipe for mincemeat and apple tart, which not only used minced beef instead of mincemeat, but actually featured images of apple slices layered over raw meat."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
