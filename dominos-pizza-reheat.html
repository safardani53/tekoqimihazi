But is it possible to reheat Domino's Pizza?
Can you reheat Domino's? Good news, you can reheat Domino's safely.
As long as your pizza is piping hot, you can enjoy it the next day without worrying.
Make sure you stick your Domino's pizza in the fridge within two hours of eating it.
A plain cheese pizza can last in the fridge for up to four days, but anything with toppings will need to be thrown away after two days."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
