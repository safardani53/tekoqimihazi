The mother-of-three completed her oceanside look with an oversized Roxy straw beach hat, and sunglasses, and wore her brunette tresses in a long braid.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Soon after the TV personality shared the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bikini photos</a> with her 3.1 million followers, many of them took to the comments to gush over Jenelle’s look. “Haters will say it’s photoshopped,” one fan wrote, along with a heart eyes emoji. Meanwhile, one of Jenelle’s admirers took to the comments to defend her from the haters. “Why do people have an issue with her wearing [sic] <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bathing suit</a>???? How old are you now?????….. MOVE ON & GROW UP,” they clapped back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The following day, the 31-year-old took to Instagram once more to share a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet video</a> of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>kiddos</a> playing at the beach. In the video, Jenelle rocked a one piece <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red swimsuit</a> that featured a chic cut-out design in the front. “Little glimpse to our #FamilyVacation 🇵🇷 #RinconPR,” she captioned the clip of her enjoying the ocean views. The proud momma completed her look with the same sunglasses she rocked the day prior and a cold drink in her hand. Many of her fans took to the comments of this post as well to compliment Jenelle on her look and seeing her children happy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Such sweet memories with all the babies You’re such a good Momma,” one admirer quipped, while another added, “Nice <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relaxing vacay</a>, my favorite kind.” Many of the reality TV star’s fans noted in the comments that they are from Puerto Rico and made sure to give her a warm welcome. “Welcome to my beautiful island Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 hope you enjoyed your vacations,” one fan wrote, while another added, “Welcome to my beautiful island. I hope you enjoy it with your family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jenelle-Evans-Thong-Bikini-Puerto-Rico-Spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Aside from spending time at the beach, Jenelle recently celebrated her six-year-old daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ensley Jolie</strong></a>‘s graduation from Kindergarten on May 30. Jenelle and her husband,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David Eason</strong></a>, welcomed her mini-me in Jan. 2017, notably the same year that they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a>. “My baby is going to 1st grade! #KindergartenGraduation,” she captioned the carousel of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>graduation photos</a> last month. Many of her fans took to the comments to note how much Ensley and her mom look alike. “There’s no way you gave birth to her. You had to have cloned yourself. She’s literally mini Jenelle #twinsies,” one fan joked, while another quipped, “Jenelle starting to look just like her mum x.” Jenelle is also the mother to a son, <strong>Kaiser Orion</strong>, 8, who she welcomed with her ex-boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nathan Griffith</strong></a>, and 13-year-old son,&nbsp;<strong>Jace</strong>, who she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>regained custody</a> of at the end of March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BtZqOdnpq5rbGMnq2apqNiwam7zaBkm6Gbnruqec%2BunKusn2K%2Fqq%2FOZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-gulas-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Danny Gulas Girlfriend: Who is Danny Gula Dating?</span></a>
