I just found out my diagnosis and they told me I needed a heart transplant. I was lucky and I didn't need it. But they originally thought I did.</p><p>"The doctor said I would never be able to perform again.</p><p>"Luckily, the man upstairs had a whole other plan for me. But at that time, I was very sad. And I just thought the best way to go on with life is to retire."</p><p>Toni continued: "I was so fortunate that it wasn't final. Babyface lifted me out of it. We were neighbors at the time and he said, 'What's that thing about you retiring? You are sad, that's all, it will pass. Everybody goes through this.'</p><p>“I always try to be positive. Although some days it gets the best of me and I’m down for that day. But I try to say ‘OK, I’m going to relish today.
