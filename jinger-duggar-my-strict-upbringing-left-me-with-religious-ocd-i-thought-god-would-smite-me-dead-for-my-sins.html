In Jinger’s recent memoir, she condemned some of her parents’ teachings, but many readers felt that the author let her folks off too easy."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I was never one to push the boundaries. I wanted to do what was right,” Jinger explained.</p><p>“If I was going to bed at night, I’d be terrified in fear thinking, ‘Have I done what’s right? Did I forget any of the principals?'”</p><p>Jinger explained that her family’s ultra-strict religious beliefs led her to take a judgmental view of anyone who lived a more secular life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I would kind of look at other people outside of our circles and think, ‘OK, maybe they’re walking with God. Maybe they’re not.’ Because you kind of see differences,” she said.</p><p>Jinger was the first Duggar of her generation to wear pants instead of long skirts, and it seems that she was cognizant of her family’s strange dress code requirements from a very young age.</p><p>“If women wore pants in their family, I was like, ‘OK, well I know they’re not obeying every rule as they’re supposed to,'” she told Bialik.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At one point, Mayim noted that Jinger seemed to be describing symptoms of a condition known as “religious OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder].”</p><p>“That’s, like, literally the definition of OCD,” Bialik observed.</p><p>“That people have these compulsive behaviors that they believe will guarantee them safety and freedom from the obsessions,” the host continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“It’s kind of interesting because what you describe sounds a lot like your brain latched on to something, you know, and it became this kind of focus for you.”</p><p>It may have been the first time that someone so succinctly described to Jinger the psychological ramifications of her ultra-religious upbringing.</p><p>And we’re sure the conversation with Mayim left her with a whole lot to think about.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WFcLbIp56eql2ZwqizwKtkprFdqMGztcKtZK6okqe2r7PIp55mpJWbwW65xGauoqyYYr%2BmuMigoKito2K8pLCMomStoJ%2BqtKnAjKCmnWWnpMKtsIyspKKslWK6pnnDnpidZZakv2652GaqoqajZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./micah-hyde.html><span>←</span><span>Micah Hyde</span></a>
