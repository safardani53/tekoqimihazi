You really don’t date costars when you work with them,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Alright, so basically we can just hope that when the show ends (in like, 15 years) they&nbsp;will end up dating.</p><h3>Laura Likes Raura Shippers</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Laura has told us before that even though they’re not together, she does love the fans who ship them as a couple.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I think is super sweet,” Laura admitted. “Ross and I have talked about this too. I think fans of other things as well, like Titanic and The Notebook,&nbsp;when you see two characters together and you think they’re really cute together, obviously you want them to date in real life.
