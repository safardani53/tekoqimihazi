Here’s how the popular fashion designer&nbsp;fits in. Rachel used to be married to record producer&nbsp;<strong>Damon Dash</strong>, who was close friends and business partners with Jay Z before the two had a huge falling out. Rachel, Solange, Jay Z and Beyonce have all traveled in the same social circle of friends — and now frenemies — for years, and it seems the blowout between Rachel and Solange was a long time coming.</p><h3>Solange Knowles, Jay Z & Beyonce: You Need Family Counseling</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3><span>“Rachel Roy came up to [Solange] in a confrontational way earlier in the night,” a source close to&nbsp;Solange tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “But they’ve had a long-standing feud. It turns out this ruined the whole night.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rachel and Solange’s heated exchange also led to the “Losing You” singer’s elevator smackdown against brother-in-law Jay Z, according to our insider.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><span>“Solange was defending Beyoncé in the elevator because Solange finds Jay’s friendship with Rachel to be WAY too close for comfort and it makes Solange very uncomfortable,” the source reveals. “Beyoncé also confronted Rachel and said, ‘Don’t talk to my sister like that,’ after [Rachel] confronted Solange.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Another source has confirmed to <strong>HollywoodLife.com </strong>EXCLUSIVELY that Rachel and Jay Z do have a close friendship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>What a tangled web this is!</p><h3>Rachel Roy’s Connection To&nbsp;Jay Z’s World</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8><span>Rachel’s ex-husband, Damon Dash, goes way back with Jay Z. The two first joined forces in 1996 to form the label&nbsp;Roc-A-Fella Records, and also founded the clothing company&nbsp;Rocawear together in 1999.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Rachel is also&nbsp;very close friends with <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>whose relationship with fiance <strong>Kanye West</strong> has brought her closer to Jay Z and Beyonce. All of these stars have hung out together and sat next to each other in multiple front rows at events.&nbsp;Interestingly, Solange and Rachel attended the&nbsp;2012 Met Gala together but their relationship has clearly taken a turn for the worse since then.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Rachel attended Kim’s bridal shower and is most likely invited to her wedding, as are Beyonce and Jay Z, so who knows what could happen between this complex group in the future!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>So what do YOU think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Was Solange right to confront Rachel about her friendship with Jay Z?&nbsp;Let us know!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>—&nbsp;Tierney McAfee, reporting by Chloe Melas</strong></p><h3>More Beyonce & Jay Z News:</h3><li><a href=#>Beyonce Instagrams About Bad ‘Influence’ After Solange & Jay Z Fight<br></a></li><li><a href=#>Solange: Beyonce’s Sister Punches & Kicks Jay Z In An Elevator — Watch<br></a></li><li><a href=#>Beyonce & Jay Z’s Happy Dinner Date After Solange Knowles Fight — Pic<br></a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH12e5BsZquZk52yrXnRqLBmopGuert5wqWmrJ1dp7KtrdOipqermJ69br%2FOpZinn5Visq2x1ZqrqKpdm7aotNNmqZ6Zo6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teyana-taylors-husband-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Teyana Taylor Dating Teyana Taylor's Husband &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
