Rob Holcomb told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a> that the show's creators heavily edited major scenes. He said, “The show is real, but the editing was fake. The inmates figured me out in two hours and treated me like gold. They were the nicest group of people I had been around my entire life." Rob continued, “Random acts of kindness made jail comfortable. They treated me better than my big brother!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He went on to explain, “They tried to make it look like I was going to be attacked.

In reality, many are respectable people who made poor decisions."</p><p>Rob’s experience filming 60 Days In is enough to make viewers question just how real the show is.

The prison system is generally considered quite flawed, and a show like this is supposed to help create a major change. Contestants who are willing to go undercover for 60 days inside of a jail know that there might be some risky moments, but they’re willing to put themselves out there anyway.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before going to jail for 60 days, contestants have to learn the details of their fabricated criminal backgrounds in order to easily fit in with real inmates.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It might be surprising to learn that some of the most interesting moments on this show actually happened when the cameras were turned off.
