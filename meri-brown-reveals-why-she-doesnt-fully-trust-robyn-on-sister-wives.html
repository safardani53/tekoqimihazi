I don’t know what you’re talking about,'” Meri says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/robyn-brown-depressed-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>She continues, “So I pulled way back. It kind of caused a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lack of trust</a> between me and Robyn. But that trust has built back up.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Robyn weighs in and tells her side of the story. “There was somebody that was trying to convince me that there was something going on,” Robyn says. “And I finally just said to this person, ‘I don’t believe you. And unless you’ve got proof, I don’t want you to talk about it with me anymore.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Robyn goes on to say that she’s never felt there’s been a “problem” in her relationship with Meri. “My understanding was because she was in this weird, awkward place and she felt scared to talk to anybody, not because of something I was doing,” she says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Meri tells Suki that she does not consider herself a sister wife since she’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>no longer spiritually married</a> to Kody, 54. When Suki brings up that Meri is Robyn’s “ex-sister wife,” Robyn whispers, “She’s my sister wife.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Through tears, Robyn adds, “Please don’t call her that. Not to me. You can other places, but not me. She’s my sister wife. So is<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Janelle</strong></a>, and so is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christine</strong></a>. I don’t know how to let this go. Sorry, this isn’t me just being dramatic. Thank you, Christine. So horrible to have her say that.” New episodes of the Sister Wives: One on One special air Sundays on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BpZqadop56o77OsKVmqpWrsqK40mauobFdqLWmecOonKympGKztrjLsmStqqWowW6%2Bzpuwp2Wfo3q0tdKtnKtlp57Dpr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-runs-marathon-rare-outing.html><span>←</span><span>Kourtney Kardashian cheers on Travis Barker as he runs beach marathon in rare outing after giving bi</span></a>
