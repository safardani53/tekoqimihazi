It didn’t go well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jackie explained to the confessional camera why she did not join the other ladies on their trip to Lake George.</p><p>"Evan is still so angry," she revealed. "I haven’t taken an easy breath since I found out."</p><p>"It just sucks that Evan and I did nothing wrong at all," Jackie expressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Teresa gets to cause all this trouble," Jackie pointed out.</p><p>"And then I am left picking up the pieces," she complained.</p><p>Highlighting further injustice, Jackie pointed out that she’s doing this "while she goes on vacation with all my friends."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Meanwhile, on vacation with all of Jackie’s friends, Melissa and Margaret mulled over how to make peace between their furious castmates.</p><p>"I can’t believe Jackie’s not here," Melissa expressed.</p><p>"It was so upsetting," Margaret agreed. "It’s not that I don’t care for Teresa."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I want her to be better and see things in a different way," Margaret expressed.</p><p>"I’ve been trying to do that for 10 years," Melissa replied.</p><p>She then jokingly asked Margaret: "Do you want hell to freeze over too?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"You direct her to do something, she’s not going to do it," Melissa characterized her sister-in-law.</p><p>"And then, to make Teresa come back from anything said about her daughters," she continued, "I don’t think it’s going to happen."</p><p>Melissa explained: "So that’s what I’m worried about."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>With no easy resolution in sight, Melissa was bracing herself for a lengthy feud.</p><p>"If Teresa and Jackie don’t make amends, there will forever be tension in this group," Melissa worried.</p><p>"And," she predicted, "we will never be able to all hang out together again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Later, at the group dinner, Teresa assured her friends that she "wasn’t trying to maliciously hurt" Jackie or even Evan.</p><p>This is when she revealed that her own daughter, Gia, is wise beyond her years.</p><p>The 20-year-old, despite being targeted by Jackie’s retaliatory rumor, had called and urged her mother to apologize.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"She said something about me, she’s upset because you said something about her marriage," Gia had told her mother.</p><p>"And not for nothing, if you went about it in a s–tty way that upset her, then you should apologize," the 20-year-old reasoned.</p><p>"I’m sure you weren’t happy when cheating rumors were going on about you and dad," Gia said.</p><p>"If you upset her, say sorry."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Instead of listening to her daughter’s advice on the subject, however, Teresa brought it up yet again.</p><p>"I’m glad Jackie didn’t come," Tre announced later at dinner.

"I really don’t."</p><p>She continued: "So tell her to shut the f–k up and stop crying like a baby."</p><p>"Obviously there’s a skeleton in the closet," Teresa suggested, "because for her to be this f–king heartbroken means something’s going on."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Teresa’s mind works in mysterious ways," Margaret lamented to the confessional camera.</p><p>"Somebody says something to her that makes total complete sense like, ‘Apologize,’" she described.</p><p>Margaret continued: "And then it goes through like, the little cogs and the cobwebs and the hair extensions, and then it comes out in like, a f–ked up way. It’s actually scary."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Jackie has spoken about the real reason that this whole incident hurt her so much.</p><p>She felt a lot of guilt that her husband, who is not directly part of the show, was dragged into the drama.</p><p>This is Jackie’s job, not Evan’s, so she felt that it was a burden on him to get his name smeared on reality TV by her castmate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Additionally, Jackie shared that Evan’s gym is a small, local gym that is right around the corner from their neighborhood.</p><p>As such, it would be the last place where anyone would go to cover up an affair, which is why she wasn’t worried.</p><p>Case closed? Don’t bet on it. Not on this show!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We’re sure that there’s more to come.</p><p>But we’re left wondering if or when Teresa will finally apologize to Jackie.</p><p>How long can she drag this out?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2V%2FcLbAnKKinV2cvK2w0pyfp52ZmbKzedOeqZ6rkWKurbnOrKtmqqWeu6awjKawZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZLChpJ16qbHRZqNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-jones-is-chef-herb-wilsons-girlfriend-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Star Jones is Chef Herb Wilson's Girlfriend (PHOTOS)</span></a>
