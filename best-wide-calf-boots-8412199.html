It’s important to also consider the material before making a purchase and opt for styles created in soft leathers or stretchy suede that have more give, which in turn makes them more comfortable to wear for hours on end (and only mold to the shape of your leg over time). All of this being said, the most important factor is to choose a pair of shoes that make you feel good when you try them on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to find the best boots for wide calves you can wear this winter without comfort being a worry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-journee-collection-comfort-foam-vellia-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Journee Collection Comfort Foam Vellia Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Journee Collection Comfort Foam Vellia Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UxXuuZU5HOJGnQcn3oTPeIGSFb8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Journee-Collection-Comfort-Foam-Vellia-Boot-e2819f3827764a80a427a551a9022a7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a sophisticated pair of wide-calf boots that are also affordable, these from Journee are your best bet.

The best way to do this is by sitting down with your leg at a 90-degree angle. You can then measure the widest part of your calf to figure out what your size is.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Choosing the Material&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When figuring out which boot is for you, it’s important to know that certain fabrics naturally allow for more space and have more give. For example, materials such as stretchy leather, suede, and stretch gore are more flexible and provide more comfort for wide calves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Make sure to stay away from materials that have no stretch to them like thick leather or rubber where this is no give to the material. Lambert suggests, “genuine soft leather and nothing too thick or restrictive.” She does warn that leather usually will stretch a bit as well so she often gets boots that are half leather and have a stretchy fabric in the back.” Some great examples she suggests are opting for a slouch boot in either leather or suede.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-22df2dcb-13a4-4197-879d-0de129adbb04></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are wide-calf boots?</span></p><p>Wide-calf boots are specially designed to fit calves with a wide circumference and offer more room. Most commonly, you’ll find that wide-calf styles come in tall-shaft designs.&nbsp;</p><p>Wide-calf designations typically change based on brand, but typically they start with a 16-inch circumference while the sizing for extra-wide starts at 18 inches and can go up to 24 inches.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to sizing, you can find wide or extra-wide-calf boots in a variety of retailers ranging from Nordstrom to Amazon. Keep in mind when reading up on products that wide-calf and wide-width are not the same thing: Wide-width refers to your foot measurement rather than the calf measurement.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How should wide-calf boots fit?</span></p><p>Certain materials like leather will stretch over a period of time. That being said, you do want your boots to fit well from the start. You should also make sure that your boots are not too snug because this will not only cause discomfort but can also cause issues with circulation in your feet.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What size boot fits wide calves?</span></p><p>Different brands opt for different wide-calf boot sizings but you can expect the standard width to begin at 16 inches and go up. It’s good to note that a lot of brands also start at 15.5 inches as well since some people can be in between sizes. Make sure you measure your calves first to see where you fall before deciding on an option.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nikita Charuza</a> is a freelance beauty and fashion editor with almost a decade of experience and is the founder of the "happy headcare" Ayurvedic beauty line Squigs Beauty.
