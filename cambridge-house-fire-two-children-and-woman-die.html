A man’s voice was yelling, ‘Call the fire brigade’ and ‘Call an ambulance’.</p><p>“There was smoke billowing everywhere and I could see flames, and &nbsp;hear the sounds of windows smashing.</p><p>“The first two fire engines arrived within a few minutes and they quickly got the fire under control."</p><p>They added: “I didn’t realise how serious it was until I saw some stretchers being wheeled out. It was absolutely horrific.</p><p>“I think there was a child on one of the stretchers and they were receiving CPR.”</p><p>Another neighbour who asked to stay anonymous said: “I was woken up by screaming just after 1am and I thought it was someone having an argument.</p><p>“A few minutes later, I was woken up properly by fire engines turning up. I looked out of my window and saw flames everywhere. They were coming out of the ground floor window and going up the wall. &nbsp;</p><p>“The ambulances could not get near because of all the fire engines. I saw the stretchers being wheeled past to get to the ambulances, and a policeman carrying a child who looked like a boy.</p><p>“It was just mayhem. I had never seen so many people out there.”</p><h2>'AWFUL TRAGEDY'</h2><p>Data analyst Peter Griffin, 30, who lives nearby said: “I was woken up by the first fire engine – but our neighbour said he heard shouting before that.</p><p>“There are trees between our house and the maisonette. I could see the orange glow of the fire. There was also an acrid smell of smoke.</p><p>“I think the family who lived in the maisonette had a large dog. It is just an awful tragedy.”</p><p>Area Commander Stuart Smith said: "This is a devastating and deeply upsetting incident that will touch many people. Our thoughts are with the relatives, friends and neighbours of the family. It’s just heartbreaking.</p><p>“We know this will have a huge impact on the local community and our fire safety team was in the area visiting residents yesterday to provide fire safety information and reassurance and will be returning next week.</p><p>“A fire like this is one of the toughest incidents you can attend as a firefighter and we’re looking after the welfare of all those who responded to or supported this incident.”</p><p>Cllr Jenny Gawthrope Wood, Mayor of Cambridge, said: “I know that the residents of King’s Hedges and the whole city will share my shock and sorrow at the loss of life in Sackville Close. To lose loved ones in such tragic circumstances is so terribly hard to bear.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I know that our council officers will provide support wherever they can.</p><p>“I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this shocking event.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ395hZBqa3Jnk5a6o77InZ6eZZikwrSxjJ%2Bgq51dqcSwecKhoKWcopq7bq3NnWSwp52Wu26wyJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-mitchell-arrest-what-did-he-do-football-suspended-form-upcoming-game.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Mitchell Arrest: What Did He Do?
