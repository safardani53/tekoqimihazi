She’s an Alaskan Bush People star and her show might be in <a href=#>production limbo</a>. Her mother, <a href=#>Ami Brown, is in grave condition</a> as she battles lung cancer.</p><p>To top it all off, Ami Brown is a 14-year-old girl with problems that plague teens every day.</p><p>On social media, Rain has revealed some of those troubles, including her battle with depression, in a series of troubling posts.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>Rain has shared this photo, which honestly looks straight out of one of those "depression hurts" commercials that used to play.</p><p>It’s a good photo, but not exactly uplifting.</p><p>Her captions only added to that sense of gloom:</p><p>"On the outside always looking in will I ever be more then I’ve ever been? Cause I’m tap tap tapping on the glass, waving through a window."</p><p>You might point out that those are obviously lyrics, and they are — to the Broadway show, Dear Evan Hansen. The main character in that musical has severe social anxiety — a condition that has a strong link to depression.</p><p>Now, maybe she shared this because this was her mood, or maybe she was just sharing a photo that seemed illustrative of the song.</p><p>But rest assured that we wouldn’t be worried if all that she’d shared were some lyrics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rain Brown shared this throwback photo, and you can really feel a sense of loss in her captions:</p><p>"#TBT to my last time in AK, it was spent with some of my favorite people, and I couldn’t have asked for a better goodbye to Juneau, I hope to go back one day but for now I got to say my last words in a very beautiful way, #AK #goodbye #stayhappy #staystrong"</p><p>Now, sure, that’s a throwback photo to the live that she used to live in Alaska.</p><p>(Yes, that’s Alaska, if you couldn’t tell from the landscape and context — AK does not mean Arkansas)</p><p>Now, when she refers to missing people, does she mean that she misses her whole family living together and doing the show?</p><p>Some of the Browns might be tired of Alaskan Bush People, but remember, folks — Rain grew up with it. That was half her life.</p><p>Or is she referring to friends she had and left behind in Alaska, left behind as she moved and moved on?</p><p>Because most of us have been there at some point in our childhoods or our lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Most concerning of all is <a href=#>Rain Brown’s open letter to fans</a> in which she reveals her struggle to get diagnosed and how easily she was dismissed because of her youth.</p><p>"I just wanted to let you know you’re not alone and your feelings matter! The way you feel isn’t stupid, I’ve struggled with a lot of depression over the last couple years."</p><p>And she got a worse-than-useless response from one quack, apparently.</p><p>"I was told it was puberty I was told I was too young to feel any real emotion that I "wasn’t fully developed so my brain couldn’t have actually been depressed" one of the main things I struggle with is my age."</p><p>Rain talks more about her age and how she’s been limited because of it, but even just that opening is so heartbreaking and so worrisome.</p><p>Because, as just about anyone could tell you, 14-year-olds absolutely get depressed. Puberty might exacerbate depression (hormones make pretty much anything relating to emotions about a zillion times worse, honestly), but depression is a very real concern in people Rain’s age. And younger.</p><p>Wasn’t it just yesterday that we were talking about <a href=#>radio host Delilah’s son’s suicide</a> after battling with depression? Zachariah was a teenager. And he was receiving treatment.</p><p>(As with any serious illness, being treated doesn’t guarantee a cure or even survival, unfortunately)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>To be clear, when we say that these were "troubling" posts, we don’t mean that we’re unhappy that she posted them.</p><p>This isn’t like when someone rages on social media or when a President posts impulsively before sunrise, to the collective horror of his friends and enemies alike.</p><p>We’re glad that Rain has a place where she can express herself.</p><p>Though she has an extraordinary number of <a href=#>haters who troll her posts</a>, she also has a lot of fans and supporters.</p><p>And her social media popularity has increased exponentially over the past few months.</p><p>She’s a strong, determined young woman and she can get through whatever life throws at her. Including depression.</p><p>But we hope that she has plenty of support. Because she deserves it.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Rain Brown: See the Alaskan Bush People Star’s Selfies That Get So Much Hate!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cK3LmqqkmZ5ir7a%2Fx2annqegobJuv9OaqWasopa2r3nBq6awpl2nsrexwKWqZpyVpb%2Bmv9KipqdlkpbBtbjEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rolling-loud-festival-lineup-chance-the-rapper-more.html><span>←</span><span>Rolling Loud Festival Lineup: Chance the Rapper, More</span></a>
