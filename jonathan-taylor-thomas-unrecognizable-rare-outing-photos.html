He also wore brown-framed round glasses and held a travel coffee mug, which he reportedly filled at the store.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jonathan looked content and relaxed as he walked from the store back to his vehicle and didn’t seem too bothered by the cameras. At one point, he flashed a slight smile behind his scruffy facial hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jonathan-Taylor-Thomas-Everything-To-Know-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jonathan’s trip to the store comes after he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was photographed</a> taking a stroll in Los Angeles with his two dogs back in 2021. Before that, he wasn’t publicly seen for eight years while staying out of the spotlight.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jonathan, who was affectionately known as “JTT” back in the 1990s, was best known for his role as Randy Taylor, son of <strong>Tim Allen</strong>‘s Tim “The Toolman” Taylor, on Home Improvement from 1991 until 1998. He also starred in several other films and television series up until the early 2000s, including The Lion King, in which he voiced the character of Young Simba, Tom and Huck, I’ll Be Home for Christmas, and 8 Simple Rules. His last listed role was in Last Man Standing from 2013 until 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jonathan-Taylor-Thomas-Everything-To-Know-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In 2013, Jonathan revealed why he decided to step away from acting and maintain a private life. “I’d been going nonstop since I was 8 years old,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “I wanted to go to school, to travel and have a bit of a break.” He went on to study at Harvard, Columbia, and St. Andrew’s University in Scotland. &nbsp;“To sit in a big library amongst books and students, that was pretty cool,” he added. “It was a novel experience for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although Jonathan is no longer on the small or big screens on a regular basis, he’s still living a successful life. In 2017, he was elected to the SAG-AFTRA National Board, which leads the SAG-AFTRA labor union and represents around 160,000 entertainment workers across almost all screen-related fields, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The List</a>.
