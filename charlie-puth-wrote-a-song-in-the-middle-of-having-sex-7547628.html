It probably wasn’t going to work out with this person and that was what I was energetically picking up, which is OK. It’s all about the experience.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I remember waking up and looking at myself in the mirror, noticing these marks on my neck, and every day they’d heal and fade but so would the person who put them on me,” Puth continued. “And we went our separate ways. I’m thankful for the experience and maybe they are as well but I just thought it was interesting that a person can fade away at the same pace of the scars on your neck.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Grammy-nominated artist also admitted that he has always “loved being naked.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m going to be careful how I choose my words because I don’t want people to take this the wrong way,” he said.&nbsp;“Again, I’m not captivated by the way that I look, but I know that I’m not ugly. So sometimes I’d look at myself in the mirror and I’d be like, ‘I really do have kind of a nice butt.’ ”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“What’s wrong with liking your features?,” Puth asked, sharing, “I have really long arms and abnormally large hands. That’s probably why I play piano. Even today, I woke up and it’s kind of fun to look at yourself naked and admire your body.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Attention" singer also talked about his love of being nude outside, saying, “I’m not going to ever be inappropriate and naked in front of people who don’t want to see me naked. But if I’m in my backyard, there’s a lot of trees back there and I know that no one’s looking in, I feel safe. You get a lot of vitamin D. Is that what the sun gives?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about the responses he receives to his online thirst traps, Puth revealed how he'd “be lying if I said I didn’t see them. But I don’t do it to force this narrative or anything like that. I’m just in [a] constant mode of celebrating my body.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his latest musical project, Puth says he does not “consider the album to be a sexy album.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s kind of like a lyrical self-correcting-of-bad-habits record, where I had to force myself out of a bad habit in a not-great relationship and do a lot of self-reflecting and become a better person,” he explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t know how hot that is to listen to in the bedroom, but I definitely had never made a project like that before,” the New Jersey native added. “This next album, however, now that I’ve grown as a person, the goal is to make the music that’s going to be playing in the background when I do look at myself in the mirror. Because I’ve never made [music] for myself. I’ve always made it for other artists and I’ve always made it for other people.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5OdrrO4yJ5kqa2knXq4vs6tnGaZXai8r7OMoqVmrJiaeq61w52jnmWfm3qprdWipaBlo5rFboOUbW5vamg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-eastwood-dating-adriana-lima-nyc-dinner-date.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Eastwoods Dating Adriana Lima?
