How awful! The whole traumatic ordeal was even caught on camera as a series of photos. Penelope can be see crying on the ground after her run-in with the door and at the time of the incident, our hearts were absolutely breaking for the tot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But while Penelope’s crazy fall was undeniably terrifying, North’s, which occurred on April 3, was certainly memorable in its own right. Nori&nbsp;was playing with her aunt Kourtney when she took her plunge. It all happened so fast, but even this epic fall was captured on film. In the video Kim can be seen staring at her phone as her daughter falls right at her feet. But apparently the reality star was too busy with Candy Crush to acknowledge her fallen baby girl. Yikes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Lucky for North, Kourtney scooped her up in an instant — what a great aunt! And during Penelope’s accident, her nanny immediately reached for the child, talk about killer reflexes. You know what they say though, kids will be kids! These certainly aren’t Penelope’s and North’s only falls, and they most definitely will not be their last. And while it’s NEVER fun to see a child fall, or worse, get hurt, both little girls came out of these incidents unscathed. But we have to ask, who took the worst spill?</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>: whose tumble was more epic, Penelope’s or North’s?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH11e49vZqmdnpq5sLzEZpuiq5mYuG66zquroWWnmsC1ecWao6Whnpx6t7XDnqZmnpGhubR5z6KarGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-michael-barrett-anna-faris-husband-3925348.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Michael Barrett? 5 Facts On Anna Faris Husband Hollywood Life</span></a>
