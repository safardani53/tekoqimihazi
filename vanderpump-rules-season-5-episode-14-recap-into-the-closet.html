Okay, everyone could’ve, but seeing it play out?</p><p>Wow. Just wow.</p><p>To wit, Vanderpump Rules Season 5 Episode 14 focused on a spa day, which had to be the most stressful and least enjoyable ever.</p><p>Prior to that, we learned that Katie and Tom forgot to put room on their wedding invitations for people to include … wait … their names.</p><p>They may know the number of guests, in other words, but they don’t know who’s coming. Minor details. If only that was as bad as it got …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Katie, falling more into the traditional Bridezilla role by the minute, ominously tells Kristen Doute that people “need to start falling in line.”</p><p>Uhh, okay Steve Bannon.</p><p>Ariana Madix, meanwhile, fills Lisa Vanderpump in on what happened at James Kennedy’s DJ set, as if LVP weren’t already well aware.</p><p>Oh, and Tom Sandoval is attempting to reboot his modeling career … with a shoot at Joe Simpson’s house. Can’t make this stuff up.</p><p>Tom Schwartz, who tags along, is star-struck by Jessica’s father. Sandoval is just star-struck by himself, or the feeling he gets at least.</p><p>“When I get my photo taken, it’s giving my soul life,” Sandoval says, and as ridiculous as that is, we gotta say we love the guy for it.</p><p>He is unabashedly himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Plus, Tom and Ariana are downright normal compared to other couples on this show, namely James and Raquel, who has trust issues.</p><p>James is still somehow denying he cheated on her even though everyone saw it and there are photos of it, but hey, it’s Trump’s America.</p><p>Lie enough and people start to buy it, or grow too exhausted by refuting the lie that they resign themselves to quieting down, or both.</p><p>In other toxic couple news, Brittany Cartwright and Jax&nbsp;Taylor take her mother’s advice and go to church. The sermon is about anger.</p><p>Stassi, while this is going on, is at her mother&nbsp;Dayna’s house, showing us a rare selfless side of her caring for her mom post-hysterectomy.</p><p>Her brother Nikolai, 11, counsels Stassi about her split with Patrick. For Schroeder, an 11-year-old’s advice might actually be an improvement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After a brief interlude in which Tom plays a hologram in Peter’s new sci-fi movie (let that sentence sink in for a sec) it’s bridal shower time.</p><p>Also known as unrelaxing spa day time.</p><p>Scheana attempts to strike a peace accord between&nbsp;Ariana and Stassi, which worked well until Katie issued more threats about negativity.</p><p>The irony is lost on her, apparently.</p><p>As Katie rails and warns against toxic attitudes and bad behavior among members of her bridal party, the accused finally speak out.</p><p>Scheana brings up that Katie is a mean when she drunk texts, which leads to a fight and a sad reminder that they are like 30 years old.</p><p>Seriously. Thirty years old.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>37 Classic Vanderpump Rules Moments in GIFs</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Finally, on the bachelor party side, Schwartz’s (or the producers’) request is for the guys to dress in drag on their New Orleans trip.</p><p>Thus, they head over to Lisa’s (where else, because it’s clearly the producers’ idea) to try on the boss’ finest dresses and jewels.</p><p>All is right with the world, until Tom and Katie get into yet another argument later in which she’s upset about him defending Ariana.</p><p>As she storms out, leaving Tom alone with the check he would probably bounce if he paid by check, we have to wonder aloud:</p><p><strong>Why are these two getting married exactly?</strong> And if they do, will it possibly last?
