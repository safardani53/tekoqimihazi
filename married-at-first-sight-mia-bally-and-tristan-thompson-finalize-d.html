and vehicles — among other things.</p><p>Tristan has agreed to give her his interest in those properties.</p><p>By agreeing to this Final Decree, he has agreed to sign any documents required to

has been a very speedy divorce process.</p><p>Mia filed for divorce from Tristan on September 4, 2018.</p><p>"The marriage has become insupportable," Mia’s petition for divorce read.</p><p>The petition continued: "due to discord or conflict of personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital relationship."</p><p>The petition concluded: "and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation."</p><p>All things considered, the two had an incredibly rocky relationship and it’s nothing short of amazing that their divorce lasted for only two months.</p><img

Sight&nbsp;made it pretty clear that Tristan had a difficult time trusting Mia.</p><p>There was Mia’s arrest when she was on her way to their honeymoon.</p><p>She claimed that she was only arrested because someone stole her identity. She later admitted that she had lied.</p><p>That very bumpy start continued when Tristan and viewers learned that Mia was using a dating app.</p><p>Ultimately, they decided to stay married … but then whatever they had fizzled out after the cameras stopped recording.</p><p>Marriages that went well until they soured can sometimes take years of contentious fighting before the divorce is finalized.</p><p>Maybe Tristan and Mia managed such a speedy, apparently amicable divorce because they never had that much passion.</p><a href=#><img width=2560 height=1913 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/09/15-most-expensive-celebrity-divorces-ever-scaled.jpg alt="19 Most Expensive Celebrity Divorces Ever: Where Does Jeff Bezos Rank?" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>19 Most Expensive Celebrity Divorces Ever: Where Does Jeff Bezos Rank?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z%2BcLnAq6minZRirrV5xaKprKxdqLaotNNmpKKZXZeurbjYZpinnF2pv6q%2F05qlZqyYpLqxv86nZJ%2Bhnpa5qsbEZpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drew-barrymore-daughters-will-kopelman-wedding-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Drew Barrymore Daughters Were Flower Girls At Her Ex-Husbands Wedding Hollywood Life</span></a>
