I’m a Swede and was brought up in a country where you were lucky if you got five hours of daylight in the winter. That’s daylight which wouldn’t necessarily count as sunlight."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000585898192.jpg><p>Then in September she shared a proud snap of herself posing in her "big pants" after vowing to ditch "dental floss" thongs for good.</p><p>Ulrika opted for comfort as she posed for a selfie in her bedroom wearing “apple catcher” underwear.</p><p>The former Gladiators host explained the real reason behind her underwear choice, saying: "Time to put my big girls’ pants on.</p><p>"Always preferred big Apple Catchers to Dental Floss anyway. I’m a comfort girl. Looks grim outside but got to crack on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000611199051.jpg><p>"Right now, I’d love someone to bring me a cuppa in bed but that ain’t happening. Gonna get my arse in gear and soldier on. applecatchers #dentalfloss."</p><p>But after posting the snap in her "mahoosive, Bridget Jones knickers," Ulrika had no idea that it would have caused such a reaction when she hit the share button.</p><p>She confessed in her column for The Sun: "Knickers have been the bane of my life. They’ve been nothing but the proverbial pain in the a**e.</p><p>"If I’m really honest, I’d like to get away with wearing no knickers at all — and do so whenever I can. It’s not a sexually provocative thing. It’s a comfort thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000216910591.jpg><p>"Having to veil my vagina and shroud my undercarriage is almost some kind of mild, modern oppression.</p><p>"After all, up until the 1800s women weren’t wearing any underwear. My issue with underwear, too, is historic."</p><p>Over the years Ulrika has fronted many shows including Gladiators and The National Lottery after shooting to fame in 1989 as a weather presenter on TV-am.</p><p>She's also dipped her toe into the reality TV realm, where she won Celebrity Big Brother in 2009, ITV's Dancing On Ice and First Dates Hotel, just to name a few.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Ulrika was definitely pushed to her limits on the sixth series of Channel 4's Celebrity SAS Who Dares Wins and decided to leave three days into filming.</p><p>Yesterday The Sun reported that the telly favourite found the gruelling tasks too much to handle.</p><p>A telly insider said: “SAS is notoriously the hardest show on telly and it pushes the celebs to their limits.</p><p>“Ulrika was so keen but not long after it started she had a meltdown and quit. She’s had a back issue and it was evident she wasn’t cut out for the tasks."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Ulrika Jonsson gets four tattoos in one day - including a bulldog on her arm and 'let's play' on her stomach</span><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpZmt9cX6SaKylqpmgrm62zqeqrKeeYsC1vsipqmamkaCypXnSnqOfoZVir7Cw2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-met.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Met</span></a>
