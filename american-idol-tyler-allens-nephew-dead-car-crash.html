They were hit by an 18-wheeler and they died instantaneously," the singer revealed.</p><p>Later, in a confessional, Tyler added: "When Noah passed he was one. He had just started walking and talking.</p><p>"I never thought I would have to go through something like this with my family," he admitted.</p><p>"Noah was like the promised child I would say. When it happened, I was more of the rock for each family, making sure everyone was okay.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>He continued: "We have each other but that part is missing. So how do we cope with that?"</p><p>"I'm gonna get through it, I can do it, but putting him to rest was the hardest thing.</p><p>"Though he's not here I do believe he's in a far better place and I'm going to see him again."</p><p>Back in front of the judges, Tyler revealed that the song he chose was the one he used to sing to his nephew when he would "rock him to sleep."</p><p>The contestant then sang a beautiful rendition of I Believe In You and Me by Whitney Houston, moving Katy and the others to tears.</p><p>The celebrity judge was inconsolable while hearing Tyler's story, as she could be seen crying throughout his audition.</p><p>Her fellow judge Luke Bryan then chimed in to say: "Katy is a wreck," and <a href=#>Lionel Richie</a> agreed: "Mess," as she continued sobbing.</p><p>The scene ended with a unanimous vote to send Tyler to Hollywood to compete in the next round.</p><h2 id=idol-returns>IDOL RETURNS</h2><p>The famed singing competition returned for its 20th season over the weekend, with&nbsp;<a href=#>a few changes in the works.</a></p><p>The program will be celebrating 20 years since it first premiered in 2002, and host&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>&nbsp;has some surprises in store for viewers.</p><p>The beloved trio of judges returned this season, and executive producer and showrunner, Megan Wolflick said they were thrilled to welcome them back.</p><p>"The chemistry and passion Katy, Luke, Lionel, and Ryan bring is second to none. We couldn’t be more ecstatic that they are returning for this iconic 20th&nbsp;season in search of the freshest new talent that this nation has to offer.”</p><p>However,&nbsp;<a href=#>Bobby Bones</a>&nbsp;who was the fourth judge in the previous four seasons was removed due to conflicting commitments.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In a now-expired&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post, Bones said, "Some of you noticed I’m not in the&nbsp;Idol&nbsp;promos this season. My contract (with) my new network won’t let me do another show right now. Love Idol, btw. Was a great 4 years."</p><p>Wolflick said they don't have another person lined up to take Bones' place, but there are alternative ideas in the works to include former American Idol contestants and winners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000715373929.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000715371617.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZ22FdYGVaJimnaKesKK6jKKbqKRdqcatsdFmmKWklaPAbrrEqZ%2Ber12ZsqKwjJyYq2WTp660tI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./styles-p-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Styles P's Net Worth?
