The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pro-wrestling sisters</a> joked about Brie’s one-year-old son&nbsp;<strong>Buddy&nbsp;</strong>confusing his mom and aunt during the most recent episode of their&nbsp;The Bellas Podcast.

I’m about to walk back to go to <strong>Matteo </strong>[Nikki’s son], and Buddy goes, ‘Mama,’ and I go, ‘No, it’s Dodo,'” she explained, before saying that he “wouldn’t let it go” and kept saying she was his mom. “‘No Mama, you’re not Dodo.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Brie shared a similar story, saying that her son got confused when he first woke up, and she went to check in on him. “Yesterday, he wakes up from a nap. I walk in there, and he literally does this big back bump, and he goes, ‘No Dodo, no.’ I go, ‘No, it’s Mama,'” she said. “I had to squat down and look through the crib handlebars, and I was like, ‘BudBud, it’s Mama.’ And then, finally, he stopped crying.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nikki-and-brie-bella-mistaken-for-mom-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nikki chimed in to joke about listening to her nephew cry. “I heard him screaming in the other room” “Why’s he screaming ‘No Dodo.’ Is he having a nightmare about me?” the WWE star quipped.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Brie continued to say that she thought that it would be easier for her kids to tell the wrestling duo apart instinctually. “Don’t I have a certain scent?” she asked. “I look at you right now, and do we look that much alike?” Nikki responded that they are identical after all. “I mean, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>we’re twins</a>,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Besides Buddy, Brie has an older daughter&nbsp;<strong>Birdie,&nbsp;</strong>5, with her husband&nbsp;<strong>Bryan Danielson</strong>. Nikki is just a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother to one son</a> Matteo, 1, with her fiancé&nbsp;<strong>Anton Chigvintsev.&nbsp;</strong>Both Matteo and Buddy were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>born within days</a> of each other in 2020, with Matteo arriving on July 31, and Buddy being Born on August 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BrZpuqmZp6o7HLpZhmq5%2BjeqS7zZ%2BsrJ1dqcSquoynoKSjmWLDqrDEqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allie-dandrea.html><span>←</span><span>Allie DAndrea</span></a>
