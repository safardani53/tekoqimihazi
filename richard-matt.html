In 1997, Richard attacked his 72-year old boss, William Rickerson, in his North Tonawanda home. Richard kidnapped&nbsp;William as he&nbsp;was convinced that William had large sums of money in his possession. After torturing his boss, Matt snapped his neck with his bare hands. He then dismembered the body and fled to Mexico. While out of the country, Matt served nine years in a Mexican prison for killing a man in a bar fight. In 2007, he was returned to the US and sentenced to 25-years to life for second-degree murder. Richard was known for escaping, having run away from his group home when he was thirteen. In 1986, while serving a year-long sentence for assault, Richard climbed the fence out of the Erie Country Correctional Facility. He was soon caught and returned to jail. In 2007, Richard nearly escaped the Mexican prison, climbing to the roof before the guards shot him. On June 6, 2015, Richard and fellow prisoner, <strong><a href=#>David Sweat</a></strong>, made an elaborate escape from the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility. The duo used power tools to tunnel out of the facility. 20 days after his escape, law enforcement shot and killed Richard in Franklin County, New York.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Richard Matt was known as one of the two escaped felons who tunneled their way out of Clinton Correction Facility in Upstate New York.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:<br></span>Richard Matt had a son, <strong>Nicholas Harris</strong>, with <strong>Vee Marie Harris</strong>.
