The photo showed Ted Lasso and Nate Shelley standing face to face, while Rupert Mannion loomed in the distance. Of course, Lasso is wearing his signature smile, while Nate is attempting to look intimidating in an all-black ensemble.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While fans are still hoping for a fourth season, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Brett Goldstein</a>, who plays the legendary Roy Kent, confirmed that season 3 would be the series' last.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are writing it like that. It was planned as three [seasons]," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told the Sunday Times in June 2022</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hannah Waddingham</a>, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton, is having trouble coping with the news. During an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>interview with Entertainment Tonight</a>, she said Ted Lasso was "too beautiful" to end so quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If I were Apple and Warner Bros., I'd be leaning on [Jason Sudeikis] like a lunatic and putting him in a corner in a little cage and giving him a notebook and a pen," she told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's a lot to cover in the final episodes of Ted Lasso, as season 2 left viewers with a number of questions. Will six weeks apart mean the end of Roy Kent and Keeley Jones? Will Sam Obisanya and Rebecca Welton become an official couple? Will Ted Lasso and "Nate the Great" mend their friendship? How will AFC Richmond fair in the Premier League?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what we know so far about Ted Lasso season 3.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-will-ted-lasso-season-3-be-released></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>When will </strong><strong>Ted Lasso</strong><strong> season 3 be released?</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>AppleTV+</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apple TV+ announced the third season will <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>premiere on March 15, 2023</a>, with new episodes dropping weekly.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-ted-lasso-season-3-about></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>What is </strong><strong>Ted Lasso</strong><strong> season 3 about?</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Apple TV+</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Editors A.J. Catoline and Melissa McCoy shared a few details about season 3 during an interview for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hollywood Reporter's Behind the Screen</a> podcast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They shared that Rebecca Welton and Nate Shelley, played by Waddingham and Nick Mohammed, are tied in the competition for best character evolution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's hard. Jason [Sudeikis] is so very generous as a producer and creator. He gives all of the characters a storyline," Catoline explained. "I think that's why [the episodes] are so full … He wants every character to have an arc."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rebecca has two challenges ahead of her in season 3 — navigating her romantic relationship with AFC Richmond player Sam Obisanya, and navigating her professional relationship with her ex-husband, Rupert Mannion (played by Anthony Head), the new owner of West Ham United Football Club.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This leads us to Nate, who has shockingly evolved into the show's leading villain. At the conclusion of season two, fans saw "Nate the Great" storm off the pitch, tear down Lasso's "Believe" sign and begin his journey as West Ham United's head coach.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hope people remember to love him, even though they hate him," McCoy said.

It was certainly challenging in that if I had a comfort area, it was in doing the slightly bumbling, awkward Nate. I was able to find my way through that a lot easier because there were lots of jokes written into that," he explained. "And then to find myself be the villain of the piece, I guess second to Rupert, who's the ultimate villain ... it's a fun place to start season 3 from, that's for sure."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for those wondering if the friendship between Ted Lasso and his boss, Rebecca, will blossom into something romantic, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Waddingham doesn't think so</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Social conditioning says a lead woman and the lead man are going to end up together," she told PEOPLE. "Far deeper is the beauty of sometimes a platonic relationship, where you will be the last one at the person's bedside, even if you haven't slept with them. There may be more longevity in that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Phil Dunster</a>, who portrays Jamie Tartt, couldn't agree more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think what we see is a real, beautiful, platonic relationship where there is intimacy," he shared with PEOPLE.

"I love you all so very much!" they cheer in a huddle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The clip ends with Roy yelling "Great job!" to a player, to which Ted responds, "Whoa, Roy Kent just said great job," as Coach Beard pretends to faint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier that month, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Apple TV+ released a teaser</a> for season 3 on Feb. 14, 2023. The short clip features beloved characters Roy Kent, Jamie Tartt, Keeley Jones, Rebecca Welton and Sam Obisanya in the locker room writing "Believe" and "Creer" on pieces of paper. As they work, "I Still Believe" by Frank Turner can be heard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the teaser, Ted and Coach Beard walk into the locker room to see all of the posters hung above each locker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Well, if seeing is believing, I believe we've been seen," Ted says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-in-the-cast></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Who is in the cast?</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Allen J.
