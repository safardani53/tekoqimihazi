Jen asks. "He has a girlfriend?"</p><p>Doubling down on embarrassing her son, as most parents do, she asks if he has kissed this girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Omar says that he has not, and Jen seems determined to keep it that way.</p><p>“If you kiss a girl, you might be like, ‘Oh she’s cute,’ but guess what?" she told her son.</p><p>Jen warned Omar: "You can contract herpes, probably AIDS.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Coach Shah was nodding along to the first part of that, but then looked at her in bewilderment.</p><p>It was the embodiment of the "they had us in the first half, I’m not gonna lie" meme.</p><p>"I don’t think that’s true," Omar replied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Jen then began to ramble about her concerns about sexting.</p><p>For the record, there are only two legitimate "concerns" to have about sexting.</p><p>The first is to make sure that it’s consensual and that anyone sending or receiving pics is an adult. The second is to be careful whom you trust. That’s it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>But instead of wishing that one could personally horrify Jen with the stories of all that many young men have done by Omar’s age, we have to talk about the "AIDS" comment.</p><p>Herpes can be transmitted orally. Mouths, genitals, and anuses can transmit herpes to each other in any of the various fun combinations, and sharing sex toys without cleaning them also does the trick.</p><p>AIDS, the condition caused by HIV, cannot be transmitted through any form of normal kissing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city.jpg><p>In order for a kiss to transmit HIV, one or both parties would need to have open wounds in or around their mouths.</p><p>Now, Jen may have some confusion on this topic — she was raised Mormon and likely had sex ed during the 1980s, when very little was known about AIDS.</p><p>But it seems more likely that she was trying to make a joke … which is, well, worse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city.jpg><p>The AIDS epidemic was a horrific tragedy that was worsened when the virus was politicized by an administration that did not care about the people who died.</p><p>We who are living in 2020 can imagine what that might be like. It is important to remember tha entire communities were lost.&nbsp;</p><p>An entire generation of gay men was decimated. More gay men died in New York from AIDS than US soldiers died in Vietnam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Viewers took to Twitter to share their outrage over Jen’s comment.</p><p>Whether it was a joke made in poor taste or an example of wild ignorance, it was simply not an acceptable thing for her to say.</p><p>Honestly, we know that this is just the season premiere, but we hope that this comes up at the reunion. Jen needs to apologize, and she needs to do it on Bravo.</p><a href=#><img width=2000 height=1764 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city.jpg alt="The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City: Who are These Women?!?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8q7HNZqqhmZhiwK2tzKacnWWWpL9urcidqmain6CybrvNZquhnV2nsqK4jKGmrquVrLa3sdJmpp9lo5a5tXnLmmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./archie-mannings-wife-list.html><span>←</span><span>Archie Mannings Wife: Who is Archie Manning Dating?</span></a>
