You can help us release our book! Check out the link in my bio to join The Hope We Hold launch team!" Jinger wrote on her Instagram page.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly this attempt by the Vuolos to "have it both ways" — sharing less of their lives with the public, while profiting more than ever from their fans — has met with a great deal of criticism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"All you do now is try to sell things to your fans. It seems like you guys only care about money," one follower recently commented, <a href=#>according to</a> UK tabloid The Sun.</p><p>"Right! Vitamins, teeth whitening strips, hair brushes and dryers. I’ll never be a sucker for any of it!!!" another added.</p><p>"Yep, they are trying way too hard. It’s not working!" a third chimed in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The criticism has coincided with Jinger and Jeremy’s surprising decision to stop posting photos of their two daughters.</p><p>"Can you tell me why we never see pics of the baby… or recent ones of Felicity?" one commenter asked.</p><p>"I was wondering the same. They both used to post photos of Felicity. I’ve only seen a few of the baby since she was born…" another pointed out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I totally understand if you want to stop posting pictures of your children. But, it would be nice if they simply SAID that. Instead of letting everyone worry that something is wrong," a third suggested.</p><p>"You were happily posting lots of pictures and videos, and then suddenly stopped with no explanation," a fourth observed.</p><p>Obviously, Jinger and Jeremy are free to stop posting family photos if they so choose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But given the abrupt shift in their social media strategy, perhaps it’s not surprising that fans have come to suspect something is amiss.</p><p>Perhaps no couple can stand up to quite as much scrutiny as the Vuolos have been enduring in recent months.</p><p>Or maybe critics are right in their assumption that there’s something Jinger and Jeremy aren’t telling us.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WBcLbIp56eql2ZwqizwKtkmqaUYremvsSmsGaupaS5sHnAq5xmrJiaxm6%2FxKWjoqaXYq5ussClqp5lppq%2FtLXOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-amymarie-gaertner-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Amymarie Gaertner Dating Now</span></a>
