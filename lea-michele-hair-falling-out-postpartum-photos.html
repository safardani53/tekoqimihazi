The actress revealed to her millions of Instagram followers that her typically thick and luscious hair is falling out five months after giving birth to son<strong> Ever Leo</strong>. “The postpartum hair loss is REAL,” she posted via an Instagram story on Wednesday, Jan 6, including a photo of fallen out hair strands. Lea held the hair in her left hand, sporting her diamond wedding band.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glee alum</a> followed the post with a gorgeous mirror selfie where she teased a hair makeover may not be far off!&nbsp;“Enjoying this long hair while it lasts because the mom bob is right around the corner,” she wrote alongside the next post. She kept her brunette locks center parted and straight in the bathroom photo, which also captured her flawless make-up free complexion. Lea was casually dressed in a nude bodysuit reminiscent of <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>‘s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SKIMS</a> as well as a white pair of drawstring pants.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Hormones are the biggest cause of post-pregnancy hair loss, and effects can last up to a year. Lea has changed her hair length a bit over the years, however, typically keeps her hair long. The star did sport a bob as her Glee&nbsp;character Rachel Berry back in 2014, but the chic look was actually achieved with a wig. In the storyline, Rachel was playing “Fanny Brice” in the Broadway musical Funny Girl.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Lea <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed her first child</a> with husband <strong>Zandy Reich</strong>, 37, on August 20, just four months after confirming she was expecting! “So grateful,” she captioned a photo of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her baby bump</a> in May. She later shared the first glimpse of Ever just six days after welcoming him into the world! Lea and Zandy sweetly cradled the baby boy’s tiny bare foot in a cute <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>black and white photo</a>. “ForEver grateful for this true blessing,” she gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The former&nbsp;Scream Queens&nbsp;star has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>yet to reveal</a> little Ever Leo’s face to the world, but has continued to share sweet photos of her son! Like many on social media, Lea got into the holiday spirit with a cute pair of matching gray pajamas! It turns out the pair are still wearing them nearly a week into January, as per another post on Lea’ Instagram on Jan. 6. “New year… still matching,” she wrote. The 34-year-old has transitioned to motherhood effortlessly by her posts on social media, and we can’t wait to see what Ever Leo looks like!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49vZqWdkWK6qq%2FHnqOeZZiWtrN5xZqjpaGenHqwwdNmp6irpKWus8DUpmSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jared-padalecki-wife-genevieve-corteses-family-album-with-kids-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Jared Padalecki, Wife Genevieve Cortese's Family Album With Kids: Pics</span></a>
