I’ll be gentle.”</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>After the GOP nominee reluctantly agreed, the </span><i>Saturday Night Live</i><span> alum didn’t just tug on that carefully lacquered ‘do, he mussed it. And he mussed it good.</span></p><p><span>The pair also discussed his upcoming debate against Democratic presidential nominee </span><a href=#><b>Hillary Clinton</b></a><span> on September 26, and Trump’s </span><a href=#><span>praise of Russian president </span><b>Vladimir Putin</b></a><b></b><span>, with Fallon joking that the pair’s bromance needed a nickname. His choice? Vlump.</span></p><p>Trump, who has previously talked about his admiration for the former KGB spy, backpedaled as he spoke to Fallon on Thursday.</p><p>“Look, I don’t know him, and I know nothing about him, really,” Trump said. “I just think if we got along with Russia, that’s not a bad thing. The Democrats are trying to say I like him. I don’t like him. I don’t dislike him. I don’t have any feelings one way or the other. And it’s not going to matter what he says about me. If he says good things or bad things about me, I’m going to make great deals for our country.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp56WuaV506uspqhdobK1v4yjoKalqWKzorjLqKVmpZWowG7DyK2fZqCZqHqprcirZK%2BhlJq8bsOTbWdqbWdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caitriona-balfe.html><span>←</span><span>Caitriona Balfe Biography</span></a>
