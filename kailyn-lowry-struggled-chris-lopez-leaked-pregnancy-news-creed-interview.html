But I’m going to guess no.”</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>On Feb. 4, Kailyn confirmed in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> that she was expecting her fourth child, and was already 16 weeks pregnant at that point. However, like Kailyn said, news got around early! In Jan. 2020, fans were already suspecting that the reality television star could be pregnant, thanks to a post from Teen Mom Shade Room. The Instagram page’s administrator claimed that the pictures in the post were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ultrasound photos</a> that Kailyn had sent to Chris’s aunt, although neither Kailyn nor Chris verified that claim. The post was also taken down.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Around the same time, another <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teen Mom</a> fan account (@teenmomfanz) alleged that Chris’s dad “confirmed” the pregnancy in an Instagram DM exchange. In <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a screenshot</a> of the conversation, a person whom the account alleged was Chris’s dad wrote “Yes!!!!!!” after someone asked him, “Is kail really pregnant again.” Both of the aforementioned posts went up before Kailyn publicly revealed that she was pregnant!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kailyn did not initially reveal the father of her fourth baby. However, just a few hours after making the pregnancy announcement in February, Chris shared a “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>letter to [his] unborn child</a>” on his Instagram Story. Fans put two and two together!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>You can catch the Season 10 premiere of Teen Mom 2 on Sept. 1 at 7/8 P.M. Central on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5FxZqSZmaHGr3nLqK6rsV2owbPBxqCjnpxdmLWztdJmo6iola96rbHApJydZaCnsqi6wKeasmWemsS0ecKrnJ6cXZ67tbHRr6Cer18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jayztwocents.html><span>←</span><span>Jayztwocents</span></a>
