I am literally so upset.</p><p>''So this is £12 and I did think to myself 'It is £12...'.''</p><p>But despite realising it's a fair bit of <a href=#>money</a> for a scented candle, Tillie couldn't resist, as she loved the smell, she explained in <a href=# aria-label="her now-viral video (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">her now-viral video</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on shopping">read more on shopping</h2><p>''It's really, really small. But I was like 'Oh well, it's natural oils and everything like that'.''</p><p>Excited to have it, Tillie then lit up the candle for three hours - and within that time, the majority of the wax had already vanished.</p><p>The following day, she let it burn a little more again - and this time, she was left with barely anything.</p><p>''I just went to light it.. [...] The wick has already burnt out,'' Tillie showed the pink candle in the video.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Now the unhappy shopper's left with some wax in a glass jar she cannot use again - all for £12 she had wasted a day and a half ago.</p><p>Tillie continued in the caption: ''So upset I normally love&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>@lush</strong></a>&nbsp;products.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Get a £20 bonus & 30 free spins when you spend £10 today</a></strong></p><p>''I completely get I bought a small candle but for it to burn out so quickly and not even use the last of it is so sad.''</p><p>Since being uploaded, Tillie's clip has taken the social media platform by storm, racking up over 1.4million views in just one day.</p><p>Loads of fellow Lush fans flocked to comments where they shared their top alternatives for the popular candle, with one recommending: ''On Etsy there is loads of snow fairy scented things that are better value for money.''</p><p>Someone else suggested: ''Get the <a href=#>aldi</a> dupe much bigger and less expensive. Also smells exactly the same!!!''</p><p>An employee of the company said: ''I work at Lush and I’m not ashamed to admit the candles are awful.''</p><p>Others also thought Tillie should take this matter further, like this person: ''If you go into Lush they have a really good refund/return policy.</p><p>''If you take it in there, even though it’s used they will help you out.''</p><p>As claimed by one of the viewers, there is indeed <a href=#>an Aldi dupe for the product</a> - and you can pick it up for a bargain price.</p><p>TikTok user&nbsp;<a href=#>jennyness1</a>&nbsp;claimed Aldi's Sleeps Till Santa candle smells "exactly the same" as the one sold by the cosmetics retailer.</p><p>The nostalgic candle has a peach, violet, candy floss and musk scent and can be picked up for just £4.99.</p><p>The description adds: "Make your home look and smell festive over the Christmas period with the Nostalgia Santa Candle.</p><p>"Bringing in both ambience and aromas, this seasonal candle is perfect for a relaxed night in or for adding finishing touches to your dinner table."</p><p>Fans of the budget supermarket loved the dupe suggestion, with the TikTok video gaining more than 125,000 views and 8,000 likes.</p><p>One person wrote: "Omg yes, I got that yesterday and I was so shocked! It smells exactly the same."</p><p>Another put: "I brought this yesterday in Aldi, it smells amazing."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>A third added: "Aldi just keeps getting better and better."</p><p>A fourth commented: "I bought this yesterday because of this!
