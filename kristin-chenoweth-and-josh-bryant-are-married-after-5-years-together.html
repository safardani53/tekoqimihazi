Chenoweth stunned in a strapless bridal gown with beaded embellishments while Bryant opted for a gray suit. Their ceremony took place surrounded by pink and purple flowers, which matched her bouquet and his boutonnière.</p><p class=p1>Many of their celebrity friends — including <a href=#><strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong></a>, <strong>Michelle Visage</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Scott</strong></a> — offered their&nbsp;congratulations&nbsp;in the comments.</p><p class=p1>“So happy for you both!!!!!! Two wonderful people who found each other!&nbsp;<span class=s1>🌸💕🌸</span>,” <a href=#><strong>Rita Wilson</strong></a>, who is married to actor <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>, replied.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Heather Dubrow</strong></a>, for her part, added: “Congratulations&nbsp;to you both!!!! Beautiful couple.”</p><p class=p1>Chenoweth and the Backroad Anthem musician <a href=#>met at her niece’s 2016 wedding</a>, where Bryant performed in the wedding band. After Chenoweth and Bryant reconnected at her nephew’s nuptials in 2018, <a href=#>they started dating</a>.</p><p class=p1>As the pair’s romance continued heating up, Chenoweth was nervous about <a href=#>how the coronavirus pandemic lockdown would affect</a> their bond. “I think I maybe had a crying moment,” Chenoweth&nbsp;<a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;in November 2020</a>. “And I said, ‘Are you ever going to [leave]? Are you going to break up with me?’ Because, you know, we were together 24/7.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kristin-Chenoweth-Marries-Fiance-Josh-Bryant-After-5-Years-Together-inline.jpg><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “That is really a testament to our relationship. He just held my hand. I think I held his at different times, and we were there for each other. That’s really what it’s about.”</p><p class=p1>While Chenoweth joked to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that she wasn’t sure if marriage was in the cards, <a href=#>she loved their connection</a>. “Honestly, I’ve never really been that girl. I think I’m going to take life each day as it comes, especially now during this time,” the Broadway icon — who was previously engaged to <strong>Marc Kudisch</strong> between 1998 to 2001 — quipped to&nbsp;<i>Us.</i></p><p class=p1>Nearly one year later, Chenoweth and Bryant <a href=#>took the plunge and got engaged</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve been the runaway bride,” she jokingly told<i>&nbsp;<a href=#>Vogue</a></i>&nbsp;in an interview published in October 2021. “Now that I’ve found him, I won’t let him go. I will&nbsp;race to greet him at the altar.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Before Bryant popped the question, he took Chenoweth to visit several quintessential New York City sights including multiple Broadway theaters and dinner at the Rainbow Room. He went on to <a href=#>propose with a three-stone halo ring</a>.</p><p class=p1>“My best friend and soulmate said ‘YES’ to me!” Bryant gushed to&nbsp;<i>Vogue&nbsp;</i>at the time.&nbsp;“Kristin is my world, my everything, and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyfnqafrLK1tIyapZ1lmqTAqXnBq7CapqRirrOxjKaYq6qZmrFurcWtnKtlZWLGpq3RrGStp5eawamx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brandun-lee.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Brandun Lee net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
