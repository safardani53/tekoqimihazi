With the Kardashians will be coming to an end in 2021.</p><p>Over the course of 21 seasons and 14 years, KUWTK helped — for better or worse — to reinvent the reality TV genre and usher in a new era of celebrity and public exhibitionism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>The Kardashians were a precursor to modern social media — a development that has allowed every day people to put themselves on display and open themselves up to criticism in the style of Kim and company.</p><p>You can criticize the family for their alleged lack of talent or their narcissism, but you cannot deny their impact on our culture.</p><p>And if you’re thinking the Kar-Jenners will simply slink back into obscurity now that their flagship series has come to an end, then you know nothing of the powers of Kris Jenner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Perhaps more than any other member of her wildly famous family — yes, even more than Kim — Kris is responsible for transforming the Kardashians from a pack of SoCal socialites into a global media empire.</p><p>Though she’ll turn 65 this year, it’s absurd to think that Kris will retire.</p><p>Her ambition and enthusiasm for her work are the stuff of Hollywood legend, and with the show that made her a household name coming to an end, we’re sure Kris already has her next project in mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For obvious reasons, many have assumed that Kris would like to remain a fixture in the world of reality television.</p><p>Specifically, they think she’ll join the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><p>In some ways, the move would make perfect sense:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>RHOBH could use a ratings boost, and recent cast shake-ups have resulted in a vacancy for which many fans believe Kris would be a perfect fit.</p><p>Ever since <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump left the show</a>&nbsp;last year, viewers have complained about the lack of an older, more mature presence within the Beverly Hills Housewife clique.</p><p>Even Bravo boss Andy Cohen has expressed an interest in Kris joining the cast:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Yes, everyone seems to agree that the logical next step for Kris Jenner is to jump to a new network, write herself a catchy tagline, and join a franchise that’s almost as iconic as the one she started with her kids.</p><p>The only problem is, Kris doesn’t seem to have much interest in the opportunity.</p><p>The matriarch has largely kept mum about the rumors, but that’s standard operating procedure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If she were to join the cast, she would probably keep negotiations very hush-hush, so that the announcement could be framed as a big surprise.</p><p>So it’s not Kris’ reticence that leads us to believe she’s uninterested — it’s the fact that joining the cast would amount to a major demotion.</p><p>It’s important to note that Kris wasn’t just a cast member on KUWTK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Along with Kim and Ryan Seacrest, Kris was credited as a co-creator and executive producer on the show.</p><p>In other words, she’s used to calling the shots.</p><p>And it seems she’d like to continue doing so if she were to sign on with RHOBH, a move that probably wouldn’t sit well with her co-stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Andy [Cohen] has been begging Kris to join RHOBH for weeks,” <a href=#>a source</a> close to the situation tells Life & Style.</p><p>“They’ve been talking about it and she’s tempted, but she’d want to play a bigger part on the production side of things, too. They’d have to reach some form of agreement for her sign up as an official housewife but there have been discussions.”</p><p>Cohen himself has conceded that Kris is unlikely to take the gig due to the fact that he’s unable to offer her the kind of control she’s accustomed to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I don’t think she would do it. [Kris] is leaving a show for which she has total control over. Why would she leave and join a show that she has no control over?” he said on a recent episode of his SiriusXM.</p><p>“She wouldn’t be an executive producer of the show, she wouldn’t have control over the edits, so I think for someone who is used to having so much power over a show, I can’t see her surrendering that power.”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean Kris and her friends on RHOBH won’t be working together at all.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Kris Jenner: Joining The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills After KUWTK Ends?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>“She’s made cameo appearances on the show before and had a blast,” the Life & Style source says.</p><p>“As it stands, she’s more likely to become a familiar face next rather than an official housewife next season, and will see how it goes from there but anything is possible.”</p><p>It may not be much, but we’ll take the world’s most famous momager however we can get her.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WGcLfRoqpmopWju6a%2BjLCfsmWjnbKtuIynnK%2BdomK3sLXNZquhnV2nsqK4jKGmrquVrLa3sdJmpp9lkprDpr7LsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-review-the-renault-kadjar-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features-2.html><span>←</span><span>We review the Renault Kadjar from price to economy and all its features</span></a>
