"UP OUT FRIDAY !! You ready ?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"DAMMNNNN LIL MAMA üòçüòçüòçüí¶üí¶" the rapper's husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Offset</a> wrote in the comment section of the sexy post, while hundreds of her fans and followers left heart eye and fire emojis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Monday, Cardi unveiled the "Up" cover art which sees her swinging in a glass bubble chair above a pool and city skyline in the barely-there ensemble. "My new single "UP" drops this Friday! LETS GOOOOOO! <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>#Up</a>" she captioned the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram</a> photo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her new music comes after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE confirmed</a> that the rapper's ongoing lawsuit brought by her former manager Klenord Raphael came to an end.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2018, Raphael sued Cardi for $10 million dollars, claiming he was fired in a breach of contract after discovering the rapper in 2015 and accused her of unjust enrichment and defamation. Raphael went on to allege in documents <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">obtained by The Blast</a> that in March 2018, Cardi disregarded their legal agreement to sign with record label Quality Control. Raphael claimed she was still represented by him when her breakthrough hit "Bodak Yellow" was released, adding that he was responsible for her spot on the reality show Love & Hip Hop, which initially helped launch her career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That July, Cardi (n√©e Belcalis Marlenis Alm√°nzar) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>countersued Raphael for $15 million</a> and alleged that he signed her original deal without a lawyer present. On Thursday, both court filings were reportedly dissolved in court, according to AllHipHop. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Documents obtained by the outlet</a>, which was first to report the news, indicate that, "This action, including all claims and counterclaims, is hereby dismissed in its entirety with prejudice against all parties. The parties have further agreed that all parties to this action shall bear their own costs and attorney's fees."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A statement to PEOPLE from both parties reads, "Cardi and the KSR Group have agreeably parted ways and their dispute has been resolved. In addition, Cardi has renegotiated her deal with Atlantic Records and is happy with the outcome of both deals. She is looking forward to 2021 and releasing new music. The KSR Group will continue its mission of breaking new artists who achieve worldwide impact and acclaim."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Feels good to be free," the Grammy-winner tweeted on Sunday in response to a tweet celebrating the dissolution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjpyYq5yZYq9uw8SaqaxlkWLAqbHEq2SsrJmYuKa%2BjJumnbGjqra1ec6nZKKmo6muqL7ApmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-brothers-holly-allen-introduces-jackson-michie-to-her-coworkers.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Big Brother's Holly Allen Introduces Jackson Michie to Her Coworkers</span></a>
