breaching FA betting rules, the 27-year-old is ready to return with a bang in January.</p><p><a href=#>Toney</a>’s undoubted talent saw him rise from League One to the heights of the Premier League in just two years.</p><p>He hit an incredible 20 top-flight goals for Brentford last season, with Thomas Frank’s side clearly missing his presence this term.</p><p>And as Toney sets his sights on greater glories, a move to Chelsea could be the ideal situation for both parties.</p><p>Should he make the move and hit a rich vein of form, it could also open the door to Toney making a sensational return to England’s squad for Euro 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dua-vlahovi-juventus-fc-celebrates-854231806.jpg><h2>DUSAN VLAHOVIC (JUVENTUS)</h2><p>Strongly linked with the Blues last summer, the 23-year-old certainly has time on his side.</p><p>He was the hottest forward in football two years ago after netting 41 goals in just 18 months at Fiorentina.</p><p><a href=#>Vlahovic</a> has failed to hit those same heights at Juventus, netting 27 times in comparison.</p><p>But the Serb boasts the physical and technical prowess seen in classic Chelsea strikers like Didier Drogba and Diego Costa.</p><p>And if the price is right, Vlahovic could have all the makings of a Blues icon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/benjamin-sesko-rb-leipzig-celebrates-848273248.jpg><h2>BENJAMIN SESKO (RB LEIPZIG)</h2><p>The 20-year-old announced himself to the European stage with RB Salzburg last season.</p><p><a href=#>Sesko</a> netted 18 times, having already secured a £20million move to Leipzig in August 2022.</p><p>He has since bagged five goals in 11 games for his new club.</p><p>But reports suggest Leipzig are happy to sell Sesko for a healthy profit.</p><p>And should Chelsea be keen to continue their new youth policy, they could have the chance to get one of the best rough diamonds around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/evan-ferguson-brighton-hove-albion-842032160.jpg><h2>EVAN FERGUSON (BRIGHTON)</h2><p>Todd Boehly might be reluctant to do more business with Brighton after paying a king’s ransom for Graham Potter, Marc Cucurella, Robert Sanchez and Moises Caicedo in the past year.</p><p>But the Seagulls do boast one of the most promising talents in the Premier League.</p><p><a href=#>Ferguson</a>, who has just turned 19, is already being hailed as the top-flight’s next Harry Kane thanks to his clinical finishing and clear aura.</p><p>He has four goals in 11 games this season under Roberto De Zerbi, and looks set to build on last term’s final haul of 10.</p><p>But Brighton are likely to charge a fortune to sell Ferguson to Stamford Bridge, while there is also interest from Manchester United and Tottenham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/christopher-nkunku-chelsea-pre-season-835748466.jpg><h2>CHRISTOPHER NKUNKU (CHELSEA)</h2><p>Spending over £1billion in just three transfer windows does take its toll.</p><p>And Chelsea could simply opt to look closer to home when it comes to Jackson’s replacement.</p><p>Step forward £52m man <a href=#>Nkunku</a>, 25, who is yet to make a single appearance for his new club after suffering a heartbreaking injury in the final game of pre-season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Although he’s usually deployed as a secondary striker, Nkunku netted a mind-boggling 58 goals in his final two seasons at RB Leipzig.</p><p>He’s set to return to training next month after his lengthy setback, and by January could be in peak physical condition to lead Pochettino’s line on his own.</p><p class=postsid
