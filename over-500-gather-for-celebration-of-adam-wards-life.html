If you knew Adam, you were around someone who made people better. If you are around Adam, you’re gonna love him. He’s too friendly, too nice. It’s love. It’s sad.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Adam had the biggest heart. He made our team better even though he was not the star.
