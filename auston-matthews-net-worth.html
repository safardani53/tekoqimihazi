Thus, let’s see more of his income and other sources of cash flow.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Auston Matthews’s net worth has increased significantly after joining the NHL team.</p><p>He made several million dollars from his ice hockey career and has other profitable ventures that add to his bank account.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Auston-Wearing-Navy-Blue-Suit.jpg><p>Some sources claim his net worth to be around $63 million. However, his total-career-earning since joining the Leafs is around $53 million. He might have added some from his endorsements to his net worth but considering his expenses and taxes, there’s no way he could have saved that much.</p><p>Not the accurate figure, but he must have an estimated net worth of around $25-30 million.</p><p><span>Contract & Salary&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Auston Matthews</a> started his career at a very young age. He was drafted as the 57th overall pick by the WHL’s Everett Silvertips in 2012. However, he opted to play for the USA Hockey League.&nbsp;</p><p>After being named the most valuable player at the 2015 World U18 Championships, Auston chose to play professionally for his last year and signed a year contract with the ZSC Lions of Swiss National League A.&nbsp;</p><p>In late June, Matthews was the first overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Later, he got engaged in a minor contract dispute over the performance bonuses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Auston-Gliding-During-The-Game.webp><p>He further demanded the team for a similar deal to that of <a href=#>Connor McDavid</a> or Jack Eichel, both valued at $3.775 million annually with bonuses.</p><p>On July 21, 2016, Matthews signed an entry-level, three-year contract that included the max allocation of performance bonuses.&nbsp;</p><p>The center was offered a new five-year/$58.17 million contract with Toronto with an annual salary-cap hit of $11.634 million on February 5, 2019.&nbsp;Auston was eligible to sign an eight-year extension, but it would have complicated the team’s long-term salary cap outlook.</p><p>Thus, the massive growth in Auston Matthews’s contract has helped his net worth proliferate massively.&nbsp;</p><h3>Earnings From Endorsement&nbsp;</h3><p>Besides being one of the highest-paid NHL players, Auston Matthews also makes $2.3 million from different endorsement deals.&nbsp;</p><p>Matthews has collaborated with high-end brands like Apple.

He then attended Phoenix Coyotes at the very young age of two and expressed his interest in hockey shortly after his fifth birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>The Matthews family still lives in Arizona, but now, in a bigger, more luxurious home. Auston Matthews’ parents, Brian and Ema, bought a Scottsdale home for $3.2 million in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>According to AZ Central, the Matthews couple purchased the contemporary-style mansion using a trust.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Leafs-Center-Showing-His-Dunking-Skill.jpg><p>Furthermore, the single-story, 7,319 sq. foot estate is situated at the base of Mummy Mountain and features five bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Auston Matthews’ home was remodeled in 2018, including 27 feet of glass pocket doors, a separate guest casita, and a kitchen with cabinets manufactured in Italy.&nbsp;</p><p>Auston showed off his lavish mansion via his Instagram post during Covid-19.
