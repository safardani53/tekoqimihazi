After some contemplating with Trump’s mother, <a href=#><strong>Marla Maples</strong></a>, they ultimately landed on the pastel option.</p><p>“When I begin a gift bag project like Tiffany’s, I always think about the host, the occasion, the guest of honor, the venue, and of course, the guests,” the High-Low Hostess founder shared exclusively with Us Weekly. “All of those details impact the color scheme, the bag enclosures, and the bag itself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Inside-Tiffany-Trumps-Key-West-Bachelorette-Party-05.jpg><p>Each gift bag included a reusable ivory beach tote, swimsuit, personalized luggage tag, pearl sunglasses with a matching chain and personalized case, an assortment of jewelry, a scrunchie, an ivory baseball cap and tie-dye sarong. Each clothing item followed the pastel theme that the bride-to-be selected.</p><p>“I didn’t want anyone to feel like they were being given a ‘vacation uniform,’” Orso revealed. “So while every gal received Hunza G [one-size-fits-all] swimwear, each guest received a different style and color of bathing suit — cohesive and coordinated, but still individualized.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Inside-Tiffany-Trumps-Key-West-Bachelorette-Party-04.jpg><p>Also in the bag were a variety of self-care items like a rose-scented SPF mist, gummy candy and a toiletry bag filled with many travel-size beauty essentials for the tropical trip. Each guest also received a pastel Key West patch to commemorate the trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Inside-Tiffany-Trumps-Key-West-Bachelorette-Party-0001.jpg><p>The gifts were a massive hit as the former first daughter shared photos of herself and her bride tribe rocking the many goodies from the custom swag bags.</p><p>The Georgetown Law alum <a href=#>announced her engagement</a> to businessman <a href=#><strong>Michael Boulos</strong></a> in January 2021.
