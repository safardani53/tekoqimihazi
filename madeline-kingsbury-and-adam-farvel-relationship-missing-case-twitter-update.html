Madeline Kingsbury’s disappearance has sparked worldwide interest, with hundreds of individuals joining the huge hunt for the missing woman.&nbsp;Madeline Kingsbury, 26, went from Winona after taking her children off at daycare with their father on March 31st. Local law enforcement agencies launched a huge search on Friday morning. Approximately 1,000 volunteer spots were filled to search for Madeline, according to the sign-up form.</p><p>According to a nasty remark on the official Facebook page for Madeline Kingsbury’s disappearance, members of the missing mother’s family have reportedly been harassed during the hunt. It occurred shortly after a strong warning against harassing Ms. Kingsbury’s family members was placed on the case’s official Facebook page. The Kingsbury family has offered a $50,000 prize in return for information on Madeline’s location.&nbsp;The Winona Police Department has also requested residents of Wilson Township, Hillsdale Township, and the City of Winona to investigate their premises for anything unusual that might lead to Madeline’s whereabouts.</p><h2>Meet Madeline Kingsbury’s Husband, Adam Farvel.</h2><p><strong>Madeline Kingsbury’s husband</strong>, whom the police have not publicly named, reported that they had returned home about 10 a.m., at which time he went to work in her car. Madeline Kingsbury’s husband had seen her for the final time before she vanished into thin air.&nbsp;Investigators discovered from Madeline Kingsbury’s husband that he left her home at about 10 a.m. in her 2014 dark blue Chrysler Town & Country minivan.
