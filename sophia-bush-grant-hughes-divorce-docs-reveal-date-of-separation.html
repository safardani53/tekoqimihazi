Bush — who has since removed the last name “Hughes” from her Instagram bio — gushed over Hughes via social media on their marriage milestone. “Today marks 365 days of calling you ‘husband,’” she wrote in a since-deleted post in June. “Best decision of my life. It still feels just like this. Ecstatic. Running toward the future, grinning and laughing, together. I love you, my favorite. Happy Anniversary 🤍.”</p><p>Hughes, meanwhile, celebrated with an <a href=#>anniversary post of his own</a> at the time. “Happy 1st Anniversary, my love! ❤️🥂 What a full, beautiful, dynamic, exciting, growth-filled year we’ve had together. I truly love doing life with you!” he captioned a slideshow of pics from over the years.</p><p>One day before Bush’s split made headlines, she took to Instagram with a cryptic message about relationships. “Sometimes you have to remind yourself that you’re something special,” read the Thursday, August 3, quote. “That you can’t be replaced. Your heart, your mind, your conversation, your care, it can’t be replaced. By anyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sophia-Bush-and-Grant-Hughes-Date-of-Separation-Listed-as-16-Days-After-Anniversary-01.jpg><p>Bush also shared a snap from a group hiking trip via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Thursday, which she captioned, “I left the house twice this week for things that weren’t doctors appointments. What a win. <a href=#>Also I love my friends</a> 🫶🏼.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bush and Hughes were <a href=#>first spotted together in May 2020</a> and <a href=#>got engaged one year later</a> in Lake Como, Italy. “So it turns out that being your favorite person’s favorite person is the actual best feeling on planet Earth 💫 #YES,” she captioned her Instagram reveal in August 2021.</p><p>While she has yet to directly address her split, Bush <a href=#>stepped out for a night of fun</a> at <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s <a href=#>The Eras Tour</a> on Monday, August 7, with <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a> and his husband, <a href=#><strong>Jordan C. Brown</strong></a>. In an Instagram video shared by Brown, 38, Bush was seen jamming out to the breakup song “I Knew You Were Trouble.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6CdtqJ5wa6qoWWXp66vwIyhrKCglah6pbXVqKmcnV2ZvKS%2FjKucr52RoXqlrdOeZKieXaiysa3Rmquip55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shake-chatterjee-apologizes-to-deepti-vempati.html><span>←</span><span>Shake Chatterjee Apologizes to Deepti Vempati</span></a>
