Upon his health scare, their set was canceled. The concert also featured performances by <a href=#>Def Leppard</a>, <a href=#>Mötley Crüe</a> and <a href=#>Joan Jett and the Blackhearts</a>.</p><p class=p1>While the nature of <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Rock of Love</i>&nbsp;alum’s</a> illness has not been disclosed, he has been vocal about <a href=#>his battle with Type 1 diabetes</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Diabetes is<a href=#> a very complicated disease</a>,” he told&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Yahoo! Lifestyle</i></a>&nbsp;in February 2019, noting that he was first diagnosed at age 6. “When you’re diabetic, there’s this everyday balance. The pancreas is no longer secreting the amount of insulin you need to cover the food intake, your carb intake. This is an incurable disease. You treat it with medication and with doing the right thing to stay healthy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bret-Michaels-Hospitalized-in-Nashville-Before-Concert-For-Undisclosed-Medical-Emergency-01.jpg><p class=p1>He added: “My challenge was brought on early because I had no choice and in some great way it really helped me step up to the plate. … To me, music was absolutely 1 million percent therapeutic. For some other people, [they] would want to talk through their problems. I would put it into music and it helped me to deal with what I was going through in life.”</p><p class=p1>Michaels was previously hospitalized in April 2010 after <a href=#>suffering a subarachnoid hemorrhage</a>, which occurs when there’s sudden bleeding around the brain.</p><p class=p1>“I went into completely just asking God, ‘You’ve got to let me live through this,…I was doing a lot of asking at that point,” the Pennsylvania native <a href=#>recalled during a May 2010 talk show appearance</a>. “[I thought,] ‘I know I’ve done a lot of rotten things. I’m asking for a break here, and if you could cut me a break just this time, I promise I’ll be better in the future.’ I’m just appreciative to be here and have such great family around me, great friends and a great medical team.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “[I] thank the good Lord or guardian angel – whoever is watching over me – that it didn’t take me out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpWpeq61wqGYnqSjYrWwv8%2Biq5qkma%2BypXnIp2SnmaOdw6q4y55km52WpL%2Bmec%2BooKynnmKwsLrCnqmtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-drops-details-of-bachelorette-dwts-salaries.html><span>←</span><span>Kaitlyn Bristowe Drops Details of 'Bachelorette,' 'DWTS' Salaries</span></a>
