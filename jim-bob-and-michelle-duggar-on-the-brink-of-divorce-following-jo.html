and Michelle Duggar are still married</a>.</p><p>That doesn’t mean, of course, that they’re happy.</p><p>Over the course of the past couple of years, we’ve heard all kinds of reports about how various members of the Duggar family are coping in the aftermath of <a href=#>Josh Duggar’s arrest on child pornography charges</a>.</p><p>While <a href=#>Jinger Duggar has spoken out against her brother</a>, and Jill wants the world to know she’s living her best life, for the most part, the family has been steering clear of social media, which probably means they’re having a difficult time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That might not be out of sympathy for Josh, by the way.</p><p>The arrest and subsequent conviction has created professional crises for several Duggars, some of whom were left without any means of support following the cancelation of Counting On.</p><p>And among those who might be feeling concerned about their future earning potential is the patriarch himself, Jim Bob Duggar.</p><p>Not only has Jim Bob’s primary source of income been stripped away, he had the added financial burden of shelling out for Josh’s legal defense.</p><p>All of this while JB and wife Michelle continue to bear at least some responsibility for 18 other children, several of whom still live at home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And there’s also a good chance that the damage to the family’s reputation will have a profound effect on Jim Bob’s other businesses, such as his used car dealership and his real estate company.</p><p>Not surprisingly, it seems that all of this has been putting quite a strain on Jim Bob and Michelle’s marriage.</p><p>“They aren’t as close as they once were because of all of Josh’s legal drama,” <a href=#>a source</a> close to the situation tells People magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“It’s creating a lot of stress on them — although the majority of the family is acting like nothing has happened.”</p><p>It seems the “pretend nothing happened” approach is usually Jim Bob’s favorite — but Michelle has made it clear that that’s not an option this time around.</p><p>“Jim Bob always wants to sweep things under the rug,” the insider said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“He’s never going to talk about the scandal because it’s bad for business.”</p><p>And if Jim Bob is having trouble coping already, then he’s really gonna have a tough time in the months ahead.</p><p>Josh is serving 151 months in prison, and interest in the corruption and abuse within the Duggar clan is at an all-time high.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Apparently, JB feels the increased scrutiny could bring about the end of his business empire.</p><p>For once, Jim Bob might actually be right.</p><p>Prior to the trial, <a href=#>Jim Bob has encouraged Josh to accept a plea deal</a> to minimize the bad press, but that didn’t happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If his parents’ marriage was strained already, then the trial — and the sguilty verdict — surely put their bonds to the test even more.</p><p>Divorce is strictly forbidden in the Duggars’ world, of course — but when they took their vows, we doubt Jim Bob and Michelle expected that they would ever face challenges like this.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation"
