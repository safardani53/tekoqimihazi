The child picked for this role is normally the most precocious child in class.&nbsp;</p><p>It is simply not worth the hassle for the teacher giving it to another child, they will never hear the end of it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE THREE WISE MEN</h2><p>If your child is chosen as one of the Three Wise Men it means that they are one of the best in the class – they can be trusted to remember a few words as well as make their entrances and exits in a timely manner without a teaching assistant having to bundle them off stage.&nbsp;</p><p>They are also unlikely to distract the other children or direct cheeky remarks towards the audience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE INNKEEPER</h2><p>You can almost guarantee that if your child is given the role of the Innkeeper they are the teacher’s favourite.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the best role for showcasing an emerging talent, be it comedic or dramatic.&nbsp;</p><p>The teacher knows that they can be relied on to learn their lines ahead of time, work well interacting with the other children, and get their timings spot on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A DONKEY</h2><p>Several children will be cast as donkeys; these children all have circumspect attendance so it’s better to have multiple donkeys rather than be left with none.</p><p>And after weeks of learning lines and songs, rehearsals and dress rehearsals, tears (not just from the staff) and normal lessons going out of the window, the day of the Nativity is finally upon everyone.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Parents watch, bursting with pride, gamely trying to catch the eye of their offspring so they can beam in their direction.&nbsp;</p><p>And afterwards, no matter how bad the acting or the singing, there’s a glow because it’s nearly Christmas – and the teachers know that there are only a few more days left of term!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FpbmlraWl%2FcL%2FEnKmerF2osKm7zqVkrJ2Tp7K1rdGyZJygmaGxtHnPmqmtZZ6WwarCyK2wZqWVlru0edKhnKmglaexcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chick-fil-a-open-sundays-new-york.html><span>←</span><span>Chick-fil-A could be forced to open on Sundays after its policy called 'a disservice and unnecessary</span></a>
