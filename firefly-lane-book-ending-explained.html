While the series has taken a few liberties from the book it's based on, it does follow it pretty closely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read ahead for a spoiler-filled guide to what happens in the Firefly Lane book.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-are-tully-and-kate-not-speaking-in-the-firefly-lane-book></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why are Tully and Kate not speaking in the Firefly Lane book?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reason for Tully and Kate's broken friendship in the book completely strays from the series but has similar results. In the book, Tully is still on The Girlfriend Hour with Johnny as her producer. As the two work together, Kate's old jealousies about Tully continue to rise up, especially after Marah starts to idolize Tully.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Kate and Marah's own relationship falling apart, Tully asks them both to appear on the show to work out their issues. However, it turns out that the show's segment is actually about overbearing mothers, which Kate is furious about. Kate storms off the show and Johnny decides to quit the show as a result. As a result of the incident, Kate and Tully completely lose contact with each other, despite still missing each other as friends.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-tully-and-kate-mend-their-friendship-in-the-firefly-lane-book></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do Tully and Kate mend their friendship in the Firefly Lane book?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As seen in the season 2 part 1 finale, Kate is diagnosed with breast cancer in the book. After discovering the devastating news, she reaches out to Tully; however, she's in Antarctica on an assignment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Kate undergoes various treatments in the hospital, she reaches out to Tully once again, who immediately returns home to be with her friend. During that time, the two finally mend their friendship as Tully helps and supports her during her cancer journey.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-happens-to-tully-and-kate-in-the-firefly-lane-book></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What happens to Tully and Kate in the Firefly Lane book?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Tully and Kate are able to repair their friendship, the book ends with Kate dying of breast cancer. Before her death, Kate asks Tully to take care of Johnny and her kids (in the book she has three children) when she's gone, even insinuating that she's fine with Tully and Johnny getting together — though Johnny protests this idea, saying he only ever truly loved Kate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the wake of her death, Kate leaves Tully with a note asking to tell her family the stories of their friendship. "I know you'll be thinking that I left you, but it's not true. All you have to do is remember Firefly Lane, and you'll find me. There will always be a TullyandKate," she writes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 2013 book sequel to Firefly Lane, titled Fly Away, follows both Tully and Marah as they deal with their grief following Kate's death. As Tully tries to live up to her promise to Kate to take care of her family, tragedy strikes when Tully gets into a car accident. Hovering between life and death, she is briefly reunited with Kate who tries to guide her on her journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKe10Z6dpbFdoa6vsYybpqijXZq7pbXNoGSesKChrqq6xJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sky-brown.html><span>←</span><span>Sky Brown</span></a>
