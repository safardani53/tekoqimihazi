Mugshot &amp;amp; Charges</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Tory Lanez’s mugshots,</strong> which appeared online after his arrest last December, have the internet in stitches. Tory Lanez, a Canadian rapper, was convicted guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion in December 2022. The musician was detained in the Hollywood Hills in July 2020.&nbsp;He was accused of concealment of a firearm. Megan Thee Stallion, another rapper, was also in his car with a gunshot wound on her foot. The arrest of Tory Lanez drew a lot of attention from the general population. The singer’s mugshot was made public three weeks after his conviction. Despite the judgment and his crime, the rapper smiled in the photograph. Tory Lanez’s mugshot went viral as a consequence.</p><h2>Tory Lanez’s Mugshot Has Gone Viral</h2><p>A purported mugshot of Tory Lanez appeared online three weeks after he was convicted of shooting fellow rap artist Megan Thee Stallion. While he awaited his sentence of 22 years and eight months in prison, his supposed mugshot became viral on the internet. Several of his supposed mugshots show him openly beaming, which has the internet in stitches. It should be noted, however, that the image is not an official mugshot of the Canadian musician. “Why does Tory Lanez’s mugshot look like a Carlton Banks?” one Twitter user wondered, while another added, “Why does Tory Lanez’s mugshot look like he just took his senior picture?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tory-Lanez-1.jpg alt="Tory Lanez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Another skilled Photoshop user posed modified photos of the rapper, adorning him with a Batman helmet and Los Angeles Lakers gear.&nbsp;Furthermore, the day before, viral photographs of Megan Thee Stallion’s bullet-riddled feet were followed by X-rays that indicated multiple gunshot fragments stuck in her feet.&nbsp;TMZ obtained the most current wave of photographs, which include images of the shotgun and Tory’s SUV’s bloodied back seat from the night of the incident.</p><h2>Tory Lanez Arrest Charges: What Happened?</h2><p>Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion allegedly fought while leaving a party in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, in July 2020.&nbsp;Authorities were called to the site after receiving allegations of a dispute in a car.&nbsp;Megan Thee Stallion revealed on Instagram some weeks later that she had been shot, and she subsequently identified Lanez as the offender.</p><p>Despite first telling police officials that she had been hurt by broken glass, she later testified under oath that Lanez had shot her in the foot. “I couldn’t walk for a little while,” she said in court. “My nerves remain affected. The side of my left foot seems numb to me. “I keep going even though the backs of my feet are usually painful,” said the female musician.</p><h2>Tory Lanez’s Request for a New Trial Has Been Turned Down</h2><p>Tory Lanez, who is now in prison awaiting punishment, was granted a fresh trial after being found guilty in December.&nbsp;Judge David Herriford of the Los Angeles Superior Court denied the musician’s plea for a fresh trial.&nbsp;The singer was convicted of carrying a loaded firearm, having an unregistered firearm, and assault with a semiautomatic weapon.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tory-Lanez-2.jpg alt="Tory Lanez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The rapper’s sentencing date has not yet been set. He has been imprisoned since his conviction in December and faces up to 22 years and eighteen months in jail if convicted on all charges.&nbsp;Similar to past celebrity cases, there was a lot of speculation and debate on social media regarding the shooting case. Fans of Stallion dubbed those who defended Lanez “misogynoir.”</p><p>Lanez’s case included the notion that Megan Thee Stallion had falsely accused him out of jealousy.&nbsp;Harris, who was also in the vehicle on the night of the shooting, reportedly got into a fight over him and other males. Famous bloggers and entertainment websites have also shared false information about the situation.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKqpYrmiusSzqmaZoqeytMCMsJ%2BarF2ZtqV5x55knaddosKov8eoq2abmJa%2FqLHSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawnna.html><span>←</span><span>Shawnna</span></a>
