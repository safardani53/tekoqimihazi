We must have a similar wish to be kind to each other and say ‘I’m sorry,’ when we aren’t. And we must have a similar interest in a show about love and have a similar wish to be funny, make people laugh.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The original romantic comedy series — co-created by Reiser and Danny Jacobson (who will serve as an executive consultant) — aired for seven seasons, from 1992-99, and picked up numerous Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Mad About You revival will premiere its first six episodes on Nov. 20, and the remaining six on Dec. 18, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Wrap.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfLGt1KVkq52ZqLKzecCnm2aglaGyr3nHrqWtZZ%2Blsq951KlkmpqfqsFuvsStrKummaO0bsDOZqSanF2Wr7DB02awqK1dZ31uxcSaqaxlnJbBpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-dinwoodie.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Sean Dinwoodie net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
