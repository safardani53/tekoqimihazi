But while the specifics of the incident aren’t explained in this clip, we can only assume Dr. Drew is talking about how Farrah has accused her now-divorced parents,&nbsp;<b><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Debra Danielsen</a></b> and&nbsp;<b>Michael Abraham</b>, of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beating her with a belt</a> when she was only a child.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“It’s so sad,” Farrah tearfully revealed of the events. “I don’t really feel like people should have to go through with that.” What a terrible thing indeed! And Dr. Drew couldn’t help but agree.&nbsp;“It’s sad to have been hurt as a child…super sad,” the addiction specialist said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the clip, Dr. Drew also provided what could be perceived as some clarity into why Farrah has had a troubled adult life as well. “There is something called traumatic re-enactment that humans do,” he explained. “One of the crazy things about humans is that when something bad happens to us, particularly in childhood, we’ll reenact it over and over again in our adult life.” But in no way was Dr. Drew insinuating that Farrah would abuse her own child, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sophia</a></strong>. In fact, he went on to say,&nbsp;“You’ve had some things happen to you that you would NOT do today.” Farrah solemnly nodded.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>And while all of this is incredibly sad, Farrah tried to remain strong — at first — by asserting, “That’s part of life.” But after Dr. Drew gave her the ok to let her guard down by saying, “Well, stop it. Stop dismissing it. That is sad,” we see Farrah break down into tears as the clip fades. Clearly Dr. Drew’s words struck a painful chord for Farrah, who claims she has not only suffered physical abuse from her parents, but also exploitation from her father after her sex tape got out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“When you get involved with the wrong management company, I’ll just say, they ask you, they tell you to do certain things,” Michael revealed in a separate preview clip. “And in retrospect, I would’ve never gone and done that.” So it looks like Dr. Drew touches the whole Abraham family in this upcoming episode. And we just hope the dramatics from the past can finally be put behind them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do you think of Farrah’s emotional clip, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
