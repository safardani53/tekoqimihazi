When they traveled to Rome together in March, Gibelli addressed why she never showed Horstmann’s face on social media.</p><p>“I can’t officially post him rn, because we did project together that hasn’t been announced yet,” she wrote, noting that she is “really happy to be sharing these moments together in private for now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gibelli is known to reality TV fans for her relationship with (and brief engagement to) <a href=#><strong>Damian Powers</strong> </a>on season 1 of Love Is Blind. She confirmed in 2021 that they split for good. Horstmann, for his part, nearly got engaged to <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> on season 14 of The Bachelorette before she broke up with him during the 2018 finale. He was linked to several women on season 6 of BiP, including <strong>Caelynn Miller-Keyes </strong>and<strong> Kristina Schulman.</strong></p><p>“I’ve never watched the Bachelor franchise or any of that so I didn’t know who he was. He seemed familiar to me and he just flashed his big ole smile at me and that’s how I met him right on the beach,” Gibelli told E! News earlier this month. “He’s very respectful, but I don’t think that they know just how funny and spontaneous and dedicated he is. He’s doing his DJ gig now and just watching him reach all these new heights and all these goals, I don’t think a lot of people know that he has it in him, but he definitely does.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabpJGgsm60zquqraWRo7tus8iapaehnpZ6qLXBnqOloV2Wv6Z50qhknZmdo3qprc%2BpsGasn5yytbTEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tulsi-gabbard-hottest-photos.html><span>←</span><span>The Hawaiian Politicians Best Outfits Hollywood Life</span></a>
