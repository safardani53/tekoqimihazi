As a parental group or a familial group, you either bond together when something like this happens, or you kind of fracture,” Michael said. “I think because it was such a high profile case, Alison’s disappearance was a high-profile situation, they came together as a team.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>For Bill, Michael noted that it was all about “trying to take the next steps” in the midst of the media frenzy. In the aftermath, Bill and Mia decided to move their daughter across the country. However, grief doesn’t just fade away. Grief is a constant ebb and flow.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While Bill and Claire (who goes by Emily in the present day) had a “wonderful” relationship before Alison’s death, the loss of a child changes the entire family dynamic. Michael pointed out that Alison’s death “fractured” Bill and Claire’s relationship. He also noted that Claire’s decision to move away from her parents when she got older “extended” her relationship with her father further.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“He had to shelter her from all of this nonsense that was happening that could prevent her from having a ‘normal upbringing.’ Because of that, because of the choices that Bill made, that Bill and Mia made, definitely put a damper on the already existing relationship that Bill might have had with Claire,” Michael told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “But the lines of communication with Emily were always open. They were always there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Saint-X-michael-park-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The actor admitted that Claire/Emily’s relationship with her mother is even more complicated. While Bill “understands why” his bond with his daughter is “fractured in a way and is much more accepting of that,” Michael revealed that “it’s harder for Mia.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Saint X premieres April 26 with the first 3 episodes on Hulu.
