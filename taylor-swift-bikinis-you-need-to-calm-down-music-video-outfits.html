She showed off the back of her bikini with a massive tattoo on her backside, covered in black butterflies. On top of the sparkly little bikini, she threw on a fuchsia faux fur coat and heels and laid in the pool on a float. She accessorized her look with a cool retro pair of blue cat-eye sunglasses lined with diamond white flowers, dangly diamond <strong>Anabela Chan Love Heart Hoop Earrings</strong>, a retro updo and bright purple lipstick.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>As for her second bikini, Taylor shows it off when the video pans across a bunch of people sun-tanning in yellow Adirondack chairs, as Taylor rocks a tiny yellow bikini featuring another tiny bandeau top and high-waisted bottoms, while sitting in the chair with a mirror reflector tanning her face.
