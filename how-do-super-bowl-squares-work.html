As both teams prepare for what will likely be the most important game of their careers, fans are getting in on the action with Super Bowl squares.</p><p>OK, we know what you're thinking: "What the heck are <a href=#>Super Bowl squares</a>?" Luckily, we have all the answers you need! Stick around for everything you should know about Super Bowl squares, including how they work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do Super Bowl squares work?</h2><p>First things first, Super Bowl squares are part of a game that features a board with 10 rows and 10 columns, adding up to 100 squares total. One of the Super Bowl teams — in this year's case, either the Eagles or the Chiefs — gets the columns, and the other gets the rows.</p><p>From there, each person in the pool will purchase one or multiple squares (each is assigned a universal price tag) — in some pools, the squares are assigned at random, while others allow you to choose your own. Once all 100 squares are filled, numbers between 0-9 are randomly assigned for each row and column.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Allison DeGrushe</span><p>Here's an example of a Super Bowl square!</p></figure><p>Now, when it comes to winning a Super Bowl squares pool, it's pretty much all luck. Each square has a corresponding row and column number, and at the end of each quarter, the person whose two numbers match the second digits of each team's point total will win. Wait, that sounds a bit confusing, so let's break it down.</p><p>For instance, if the Eagles have a 17-14 lead after the second quarter, the person who occupies the square with "7" for the Eagles and "4" for the Chiefs is the winner. That makes sense, right?</p><p>Super Bowl LVII will take place on Feb. 12 on Fox, with kickoff taking place at 4:30 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOoZKytoJq%2Fbq7OsKNmq6GqrrOx0mauqKqb</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woman-charged-murder-after-woman-found-dead.html><span>←</span><span>Woman, 61, charged with murder after 'very kind disabled' woman in her 50s found dead in Surrey</span></a>
