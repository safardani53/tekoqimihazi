She met up with her brother at Baby Bella Boutique.&nbsp;</p><p>Kermit’s girlfriend was six months pregnant, and Joseline was concerned over how he would react to it. Also, she was worried about how he would feed his family.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“How are you going to be able to put food on the table for the kids?” she asks, and he responds, “How everyone else did it.”</p><p>Joseline became vocal about her brother not taking the same method to parenting as Stevie and wanted him to find a way to provide for his children.&nbsp;</p><p>You could tell she gave Kermit some food for thought. The wheels were spinning in his mind about the best route to take.&nbsp;</p><p>Joseline then made her way to the Yoga center to meet up with some of her girlfriends. She chatted to them about the possibility of having a water birth.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Defina wanted to go the water birth route, but she let Joseline know it quickly went the other way.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wanted to do a water birth as well, but by the time I got to the hospital I did three pushes, and it was out,” she reveals.</p><p>After that, Tamika gave Joseline an infant simulator to get to grips with being a parent. Joseline&nbsp;was happy with this.</p><p>Joseline then revealed that Nikki Mudarris was coming to town for some "pregnant sex."</p><p>“Nikki [Mudarris] is coming into town tonight, and she definitely wants to have pregnant sex, but I’m really not feeling it because, you know, I’ve got this big stomach, but we all know my baby’ll freak,” Joseline explains to her gym trainer.</p><p>“So I guess we need to speak to her and see where her mind is at.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We then got to see the two women in bed together with sexy lingerie on. They were trying to get intimate to send Joseline into labor.&nbsp;</p><p>It did not work.&nbsp;</p><p>At the baby shower, everyone managed to stay civil, and it showed a different side to the cast members. Everyone was smiling and chatting about happy things. &nbsp;</p><p>We then flashed-forward to December 28, 2016. Joseline started feeling contractions and went into labor at home. She decided to go to the hospital when the pain became too much.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>After the birth, she called Stevie to let him meet his daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>As I look at Bonnie for the first time, it’s unbelievable. There’s nothing better you can accomplish in the whole wide world than to be a mother. It’s a feeling that no one can explain,” Joseline says during her final confessional of the evening.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of all the developments?</p><p>Sound off below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Joseline and Stevie J: Love & Hip Hop Atlanta Feud Goes NUCLEAR!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WCcLjOr5xmmZ6Zeqm1z2afqKhdlsGtrc2tmGarlZbAsLqMb2SeqJmovKWxjHJkq52Tlr1uts6snKWhnprAbr%2FPnppo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jane-mcdonald-issues-stern-warning-strips-totally-naked-show.html><span>←</span><span>Jane McDonald issues stern warning to viewers as she strips totally naked on new TV show</span></a>
