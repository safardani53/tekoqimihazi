But this week the fantasy became an extra-ordinary reality for me when I was a billionaire Bugatti owner for a day and joined the 220mph club.</p><p>My adrenalin was pumping even before I got into the Bugatti. This is a car mere mortals don’t ever get the chance to drive.</p><p></p><p>I like speed but nothing prepares you for the assault on your senses the Bugatti delivers, starting with the awesome sound of the monster 8litre W16 engine — which feels even more intense because of the open top.</p><p>It’s like sitting bang in the middle of a volcano as it erupts around you and the sound builds up to a wall of noise like no other you’ll ever hear coming from a road car. There’s a wonderfully piercing whirring from the turbos that accompanies the thunderous engine note and adds to the sheer drama of the Bugatti.</p><p>In full flow it pumps out a hard-to-believe 1,200 horsepower — 199 more than the previous model. It’s like being pulled along by your own herd of wild horses.</p><p>The acceleration is breathtaking and when you floor the accelerator your body is flung back into the seat. From 0 to 62mph in 2.6 seconds, a mile disappears in a blur of 25 seconds. It’s scary but exhilarating.</p><p>The Vitesse has a split personality. You can drive it as sedately as a vicar on a Sunday meander. It evens cruises at 120mph with the roof down. But blip the accelerator and an avalanche of power launches the Bugatti like an Exocet missile.</p><p>On a special race circuit I got close to pushing the Bugatti to its limits and it’s unreal, like being propelled by a super-human force.</p><p>It’s difficult to concentrate on the speed as you’re too busy hanging on to the wheel but you do, thanks to the car’s all-wheel-drive and amazing grip.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more motors</h2></p><p>Cornering at more than 150mph and flashing past 200mph on the straight shouldn’t feel normal or reassuring — but in the Bugatti Vitesse it does. I’m happy to concede my nerve ran out at 225mph, with my heart pumping, although the car clearly had more in reserve.</p><p>The engine gets its extra 199hp from four larger turbochargers with new intercoolers.</p><p>To cope with the extra power and stop you from taking off, Bugatti engineers have re-enforced the chassis, and the dampers have been adapted from motor racing.</p><p>You also get a giant rear wing that pops up above 150mph, to add even more drama. And the brakes have larger air intakes to help bring the Vitesse to a shuddering halt from warp factor five.</p><p>A new roof spoiler has been developed to reduce wind noise and buffeting at high speeds.</p><p>Everything about the Vitesse is special, it has a carbon-fibre body and is finished in a unique Blue Carbon, while the lower body and side skirts are finished in a lighter “lake blue”, with blue 20in alloys.</p><p>Surprisingly, up close the Bugatti actually seems quite small. It’s 4,462mm long and just 1,190mm high — but a width of 1,998mm makes crowded back streets in Spain a tricky proposition.</p><p>On the inside it’s a fabulous cocktail of dark blue carbon-fibre trim, thick aluminium and hand-stitched blue leather sports seats that make long journeys like a flight in your own personal jet.</p><p>And in many ways that is the nearest thing I can relate the Vitesse to — it’s a jet with four wheels.</p><p>The Vitesse comes with hard-top roof and a strange umbrella-like temporary canvas roof that can be stored away in the front boot but seems unworthy and too fiddly for a car that costs nearly £1.6million.</p><p>So is the Grand Sport Vitesse worth that price? For billionaires it’s more like buying a collector’s work of art than just a car — and if you’ve got that kind of money, why not?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgpRrZ3FpX6yybr7Er6Cer12ptaZ5wa6emqyknnq3sdirpqdll6eur7CMrKeoqqRiw6rAxKyqnmWWp7yuec%2BroJydXam8brHCqKWopalirq%2BwjJqjpWWZqcBussSaq66qlah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./orphan-black-naturaleza-reprimida-y-excitada.html><span>←</span><span>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</span></a>
