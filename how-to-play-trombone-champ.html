Touted as "the world's first trombone-based rhythm music game," this off-kilter oddity seems to have taken the internet by storm with its hilarious gameplay and mechanics.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>The game is often described as a trombone-based Guitar Hero, just without the necessity of expensive plastic peripherals you'd have to plug into a console.</p><p>Shockingly enough, gamers are flocking to this simple and strange new title and drawing legitimate enjoyment from what is otherwise a silly and relatively cheap-looking title. If you're at all curious about Trombone Champ mania, here's a quick guide on how to play.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Holy Wow Studios</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to play 'Trombone Champ,' if you're into that sort of thing.</h2><p>Gameplay for Trombone Champ is both simple and deceptively challenging. Like any rhythm game, the goal is to play your trombone properly to the in-game beat of the soundtrack. The game is also currently only available for PC, so there's really only so many ways you can play.</p><p>You'll need a mouse and a keyboard to start (again, no obnoxious plastic trombone necessary). To play the game, simply press any letter key at the right time as notes slide across the screen.</p><p>Use your mouse to move the in-game slider when the game asks to move up and down. These movements are meant to simulate real trombone-playing motions. You'll also have to time your notes carefully, as your in-game tromboner can run out of breath if you're not careful.</p><p>You're encouraged to play each song properly, but even messing up on certain notes can lead to some hilarious musical results. You can even collect Tromboner Cards and unlock secret content as you progress through the game.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>That's really all there is to it!
