Not Covid! Not Covid at all! But she's not feeling well so she danced sick and she had to leave. But she's okay!”</p><p>Suni returned to the stage for the relay dances, though Tyra once again focused on the awkward moment.</p><p>Tyra told the athlete: "Suni, I got to ask you. I know you've been struggling all day and, like, dude is like, you're throwing up. This is live TV and you ran off!”</p><p>The model was slammed for repeatedly pointing out that Suni had thrown up, instead of tactfully brushing over it to save the teen from further embarrassment.</p><p>More recently, the host was&nbsp;<a href=#>called out by fans for "taking too long" to announce Iman Shumpert as the season's winner</a>&nbsp;during the finale.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000694044482.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000695717566.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>DWTS host Tyra Banks 'takes too long' to announce winner as Iman Shumpert's reaction is 'cut off' on finale</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY2qEdYCVaJuwrKNiwbq%2BwGaZmqabqHq0tNStqmacn6y7brXCnmScqpWWum6%2FzKKxnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./collin-sextons-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Collin Sexton Dating Collin Sexton's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
