he has also been featured in music videos (albeit against his will).</p><p>It wasn’t that long ago when Kanye West came out with a stop-motion video depicting him kidnapping and burying Pete alive.</p><p>Maybe Britney doesn’t listen to Kanye’s music (which is fair; I haven’t, either), but it was still big news in the music scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In 2018, Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande were absolutely everywhere.</p><p>Their whirlwind romance and engagement and then their breakup were can’t-miss content.</p><p>From Ariana’s "Thank U, Next" to the popularization of the phrase "big dick energy," it was a major moment in the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Even following that relationship crashing and burning, Pete continued to make the news.</p><p>He dated legendary hotties, from Kate Beckinsale to Kaia Gerber.</p><p>And let’s not forget that Pete was already a widely desired commodity himself, albeit to a smaller audience, before his penis started opening doors for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Pete joined SNL as the youngest (and one of the hottest) cast members in the show’s history.</p><p>Even when he was just trash-talking his hometown of Staten Island or participating in outrageously funny skits, people noticed him.</p><p>(To date, one of my favorite skits of all time is the "Posters" skit with Emma Stone, which starred Pete)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So … why didn’t Britney know who he was?</p><p>First of all, because she doesn’t have to.</p><p>Britney is a world-famous phenomenon and has been a household name since Pete was a little kid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s also worth mentioning that Britney spent many years under a conservatorship.</p><p>It has been strongly suggested that this unjust arrangement filtered her exposure to the rest of the world, even to what news she read.</p><p>And a simpler explanation is that maybe Britney doesn’t look at headlines after the vicious way in which she has been portrayed in them for most of her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When people express envy over Britney’s blissful unawareness of Pete and Scott, it’s not out of hatred for them.</p><p>Instead, it’s at times difficult to imagine what life must be like for someone to not be constantly aware of every world event, every meme, every piece of discourse.</p><p>As always, we wish Britney the absolute best as she continues to embrace her freedom and run wild on social media.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcK7RoqunnaliwLGxwKuqZpyfmsCvwIykpaivXay1sHnPnqueZZSWw6qw0qilZqGjYrK5tdKtqmahnmKubrzUq5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-howey-sarah-shahis-relationship-timeline-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Howey, Sarah Shahi's Relationship Timeline: Photos</span></a>
