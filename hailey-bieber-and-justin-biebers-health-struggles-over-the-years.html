Each day has gotten better and through all of the discomfort, I have found comfort in the one who designed me and knows me. I’m reminded he knows all of me,” the “Love Yourself” singer wrote via Instagram in June 2022, just days after revealing that he was <a href=#>suffering from Ramsay Hunt Syndrome</a>.</p><p>“It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and <a href=#>has caused my face to have paralysis</a>,” the Canada native explained in his initial post about the neurological disorder. “As you can see, this eye is not blinking. I can’t smile on this side of my face. This nostril will not move.”</p><p>Three months before Justin opened up about his partial paralysis, Hailey was <a href=#>hospitalized after experiencing stroke-like symptoms</a>.</p><p>“I had a very scary incident on March 10. Basically, I was sitting at breakfast with my husband, having a normal day, normal conversation, and we were in the middle of talking and all of a sudden, I <a href=#>felt this really weird sensation</a> that kind of like traveled down my arm from my shoulder all the way down to my fingertips,” the model explained in an April 2022 YouTube video. “It made my fingertips feel really numb and weird.”</p><p>Calling the experience the “<a href=#>scariest moment of [her] life</a>,” the Arizona native recalled what doctors told her when she arrived at the emergency room.</p><p>“[They] were able to see that I had <a href=#>suffered a small blood clot in my brain</a>, which they labeled and categorized as something called a TIA [Transient Ischemic Attack], basically it’s like having a mini-stroke,” she explained. “I felt really thankful and grateful that it wasn’t worse, and I wouldn’t have any permanent issues.”</p><p>Justin and Hailey, who <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in September 2018, have supported each other <a href=#>through their respective medical scares</a>.</p><p>“I love u baby,” the Rhode founder wrote via her Instagram Story in June 2022, <a href=#>resharing Justin’s video</a> detailing his Ramsay Hunt Syndrome diagnosis.</p><p>That same month, Hailey <a href=#>addressed both her and her husband’s well-being</a> during an appearance on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I am doing OK. … I’m just kind of allowing my body the time to heal and do its thing, but I’m doing OK,” she shared. “[Justin’s] also doing OK. Obviously, it’s been <a href=#>a weird turn of events</a> the last couple months — the last even, few days — but he’s OK. He’s gonna be totally OK.”</p><p>Scroll through for a look at the married couple’s health battles over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktaK1y56wZpqZmq%2BmvoyapZ1lmqrAtbXNZpminZKav7R5x56YpayYYsC1vtSgnqWdo2K8t7HRZquhnV2usqK%2B0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evvie-mckinney-19970627-html.html><span>←</span><span>Evvie McKinney (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
