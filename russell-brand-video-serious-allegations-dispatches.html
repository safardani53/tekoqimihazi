These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream - when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I have written about extensively in my books I was very very promiscuous</p><p>Now during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual. I was always transparent about that then, almost too transparent. And I'm being transparent about it now as well.&nbsp;</p><p>And to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal that I absolutely deny makes me question is there another agenda at play?</p><p>Particularly when we have seen coordinated media attacks before - like with Joe Rogan when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstream media didn't approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language.</p><p>I’m aware that you guys have been saying in the comments for a while ‘Watch out Russell, they are coming for you, you are getting too close to the truth, Russell Brand did not kill himself’.</p><p>I know that a year ago there was a spate of articles ‘Russell Brand is a conspiracy theorist, Russell Brand’s right wing’.</p><p>I’m aware of news media making phone calls, sending letters to people I know for ages and ages.</p><p>It’s been clear to me or at least it feels to me like there's a serious and concerted agenda to control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices and I mean my voice along with your voice.</p><p>I don't mind them using my books and my stand up to talk about my promiscuous&nbsp; consensual conduct in the past. What I seriously refute are these very very serious criminal allegations.&nbsp;</p><p>Also it’s worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems to me to be a coordinated attack</p><p>Now I don't want to get into this any further because of the serious nature of the allegations, but I feel like I'm being attacked and plainly they are working very closely together</p><p>We are obviously going to look into this matter because it’s very, very serious. In the meantime I want you to stay close, stay awake but more important than any of that if you can, please, stay free.</p><p>The actor also said there had been calls for his Community Festival in Hay-on-Wye to be cancelled.</p><p>On Friday, it emerged Channel 4 will highlight behaviour by an A-list celebrity in a Dispatches programme due to air at 9pm on Saturday night.</p><p>There is no indication that Brand will be covered in the programme.</p><p>A source told The Mirror: "This programme has been years in the making and is being edited up to the last minute."</p><p>The Channel 4 TV guide lists tonight's programme as 'New: Dispatches Special. A 90-minute special Dispatches investigation'.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Despite serious claims made against him, Brand is still set to perform in front of thousands at Wembley tonight.</p><p>The comedian is yet to cancel the sold out gig for 2,000 people at Troubadour Wembley Park in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/234101ff-2098-43c4-b951-0d6e56dada3e.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/russell-brand-seen-june-26-845236637-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2007-visited-shops-hampstead-returning-348338865.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B6hJFpaGpnoqrAtLHLpWSbqpGjsW7CyJ2cqGWjmr%2Bqu9SsZJqknJq0osDIqKWsZZSewLGt05yfnqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oceans-of-fun-kansas-city-girl-death.html><span>←</span><span>Oceans of Fun 'drowning' - Young girl dies in Kansas City after being pulled from water at amusement</span></a>
