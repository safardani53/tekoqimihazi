But no one forced me to do it.</p><p>I played the young Calypso (her English actress mother, Rosemary Harris, played the character as an older woman) and had some very full-on scenes. I went home one day and was physically sick.</p><p>It never occurred to me that I was too young to deal with it all. I thought I was so grown up, because I had lived on my own for years and years. I was an<br>only child and comfortable with my own company. I attended 18 separate schools, because my parents (her father is American novelist John Ehle) moved between America, where I was born, and Britain.</p><p>I went to a mixed boarding school at 15 in Michigan, USA, and only lived with my parents for a few weeks at a time, after that.</p><p>I only got British citizenship the year we did Pride And Prejudice. I thought London would be a nicer city to be unemployed in than New York or Los<br>Angeles.</p><p>Colin Firth? He is a very nice guy and a very good actor. We did have a relationship for about a year. But by the time Pride And Prejudice came out, we were not a couple any more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1666708.main_image.jpg><p>There was a silly photograph taken the first time we ever met. Photographers draped us around each other in the Blue Peter garden at the BBC. It was taken before the relationship started and used only after the relationship ended. But it didn’t upset me.</p><p>One thing I noticed about working for five months non-stop wearing the dresses on Pride And Prejudice was that my body started to change shape. Everything was squeezed downwards, because of the corsets.</p><p>It must have meant that in the early 1800s women looked very different, as they started wearing the things from the age of 17.</p><p>I’ve had good years and lean years.</p><p>I cannot say that my time out of work came as any surprise but I always thought badly of myself when not working.</p><p>I even went in to Waterstones a couple of years after I had done Pride And<br>Prejudice to ask how to apply for a job there. They said I would have to send in my CV and I chickened out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1666709.main_image.jpg><p>One thing I did know at 18 was that work and unemployment sit side by side as an actress. It is just the way it is. But there was no way I could have known what it does to you. Spending too long navel-gazing, waiting for work, can eventually turn you funny. It did my head in.</p><p>I remember doing a film, This Year’s Love, with my character saying: ‘I am<br>coming up to 30, getting life sorted out.’</p><p>I put myself in to that category, without a doubt. I was 29 at the time and trying to get the balance right between work and life outside work.</p><p>I hadn’t had a relationship for more than three years and I was out of the loop.</p><p>What did I miss? I always thought it would have been great to have someone to hold the other end of the tape measure, as I was doing up a kitchen in a flat at the time.</p><p>When I met my husband, was it love at first sight? I was certainly in love on our first date.</p><p>Marriage? I never dreamt about being a bride and cannot honestly say why getting married felt right. But I did want children.</p><p>So much of my life with a family is NOT about work — and that is something which is impossible to predict at 18.</p><p>I am even known as Jennifer Ryan, rather than Ehle, where we live.</p><p>But for a film like Zero Dark Thirty, it’s fantastic to be involved. It is great to see a grown-up movie which does not patronise its audience. That’s a thrill that does not go away, whatever my age.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaYRxg5duZqahnKG2sLrSZq6orZyZerSxxGaknmWelrimsIyopWaslaG5uns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./linda-caicedo.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Linda Caicedo net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
