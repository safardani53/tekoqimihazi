Her loss is deeply profound and my heart is full of sadness.”</p><p>The “Respect” singer died at age 76 at her home in Detroit after battling advance pancreatic cancer. “In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart,” Franklin’s family said in a statement from her publicist, <strong>Gwendolyn Quinn</strong>,&nbsp;on Thursday. “We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and cousins knew no bounds.”</p><p>See more reactions below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The whole world will miss her but will always rejoice in her remarkable legacy.
