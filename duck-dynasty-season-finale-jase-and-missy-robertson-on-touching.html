The daughter of Jase and Missy Robertson was born with a cleft palate and received corrective surgery.</p><p>If you <a href=#>watch Duck Dynasty online</a>, you’re “gonna go from gut-wrenching laughter to crying, because it’s very sweet,” Missy tells People of Mia’s ordeal.</p><p>Adds Jase Robertson, the laid-back brother famous for his no-worries attitude: “I was never an emotional guy until I had a daughter who had problems.”</p><p>“When you hand your daughter off to some doctors and you know they’re going to cut on her, that’s tough. I lost it. So much for not being emotional.”</p><p>Were they worried about the public scrutiny Mia (seen with mom, dad and big brothers Reed and Cole above) might face as a result of the episode?</p><p>“Of course, that was a worry,” says Jase. “There have been times when kids made fun of her for how she looks. We’ve had to have some serious talks about it.”</p><p>The Robertsons formed the Mia Moo Fund, whose slogan is “Because Every Kid Deserves A Smile,” to raise awareness and help children with similar problems.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>“We hope after [<a href=#>Duck Dynasty Season 5 Episode 10</a>], people will connect with us even more,” says Missy. “I wrote a song with Gary Chapman about it, and Mia sings on it.”</p><p>“It’s called ‘Angel Child’ … I hope it shows our hearts.”</p><p>One of the biggest struggles of the past year for the family? The uproar after patriarch <a href=#>Phil Robertson’s comments</a> about race and homosexuality to GQ.</p><p>“For those of us who were there for the interview, we knew what was happening,” says Jase, the second eldest of Phil’s four sons. “I was uneasy right off the bat.”</p><p>“We felt like the guy doing the interview kind of inflamed things and took them out of context. You don’t have to agree with someone to love them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg>Watch Duck Dynasty Season 5 Episode 10 Online<p>“My dad loves all people, regardless of their race and sexual orientation. He said that in the interview, which went on for four hours. That didn’t make the final story, of course.”</p><p>Jase bristles slightly when the talk turns to race.</p><p>“That was just ridiculous,” he says. “Everyone was made by God. That was the part that made us a little mad, to make it sound like my father is a racist.”</p><p>“My dad is the most non-racist person I’ve ever been around. We were taught at an early age that you don’t base any kind of opinion on people’s external appearance.”</p><p>He continues: “I’ve shed my blood in school, having fights taking up for kids who were different, who people made fun of. That’s how we were raised.”</p><p>Adds Missy: “I think this is good because it’s <a href=#>gotten people to talk</a> about some serious issues. Everything is an opportunity for learning and understanding.”</p><p>Looking head to Duck Dynasty Season 6 this fall? “We’re going to keep doing what we do,” says Jase. “People will have their opinions about us.”</p><p>“We’re just trying to do the right thing. We’re really thankful to the people who have supported us through everything. We have met a lot of great people.”</p><p>“There are a lot of people with problems out there.”</p><p>“Sometimes, we’ll meet some of them who’ll say ‘I’m so glad your show is on, because despite my lowest moments, I have something to chuckle about.'”</p><p>“We’re a healthy distraction, you know. That’s what we want to be.”</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Duck Dynasty Stars Without Beards!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2WAcLDUnKJmnKmjrrTA2GaqnpmjpLtussinmKWdXZ%2ButLGMmqWdZZ2ewLTFjKumm52iqcCwuoyopWasn6qwqbXNoGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fabian-basabe-still-not-gay-after-all-these-gays-20050527-php.html><span>←</span><span>Fabian Basabe: Still not gay after all these gays</span></a>
