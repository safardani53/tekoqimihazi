In the game, everyone starts with Gwen, whom the player meets at Alt Harbor. It's assumed Gwen and Stella know each other prior to their meeting at Alt Harbor.</p><p>Here is where players can expect to find the rest of the spirits:</p><ul><li><strong>Atul</strong> is Stella's paternal uncle and can be found at Barkensheim Creek.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Summer</strong> is a spiritual snake and can be found in Hummingberg.</li><li><strong>Alice </strong>the hedgehog can be found at Mount Toroyama.</li><li><strong>Astrid </strong>the lynx will be located at Bottom Line Corp.</li><li><strong>Giovanni</strong>, the lion and Astrid's husband, is found in Loneberg.</li><li><strong>Gustav </strong>the art-loving bird is located at Furogawa.</li><li><strong>Bruce and Mickey, </strong>the tough brother duo, are found on Southpoint Docks.</li><li><strong>Buck </strong>the basilisk is at Hikarishima Lighthouse.</li><li><strong>Elena </strong>the dog can be found at Crow's End Inc.</li></ul><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><ul><li><strong>Stanley </strong>the mushroom can only be grown with a mystery seed.</li><li><strong>Lily, </strong>Stella's younger sister, will present herself on Stella's boat once the player has helped enough spirits pass through the Everdoor.</li></ul><p>Many of these spirits can't be unlocked until other skills have been earned, which requires helping some spirits pass through the Everdoor. Unfortunately, even if you don't particularly like a certain spirit on Stella's boat, you still have to help them pass over.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are three more spirits expected to be added to 'Spiritfarer' by the end of 2021.</h2><p>In addition to these spirits that you can currently find throughout the map, Thunderlotus announced there would be three more spirits added to the game by the end of 2021.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">development roadmap</a> for the year, the team outlined the new spirits players will see added to the game in two more updates. Two of these spirits will be added as part of a new island.&nbsp;</p><p>Beverly will be coming to Oxbury in the summer. As Stella's old neighbor, the bird-like spirit will join the ship and reminisce about the past with our Spiritfarer.&nbsp;</p><p>Daria and Jackie are two more spirits who will be added to the game during its fall update. Their introduction comes with a new, currently unnamed island. Jackie is an overworked caretaker at the hospital on the island, while Daria is his primary patient. Both will join your boat with their own journeys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmq6hllp67pXnApaNmq6Cev6rA0maqqaGinsGnrdGeqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sadie-sink-worst-red-carpet-helen-mirren.html><span>←</span><span>Sadie Sinks Worst Red Carpet Look Was With Helen Mirren</span></a>
