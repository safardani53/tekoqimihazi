He can defeat penalties pretty well.</p><p>However, Kuraly does not seem to have high-end skill for the highest level as of now. Therefore, they kept him to bottom-six forward duty in the National Hockey League.</p><p>When it comes to physicality, Kuraly seems inconsistent. He can play well either in the position of centre or wing.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Initially, Sean’s NHL rights were with the San Jose Sharks as they drafted him as the 133rd overall pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. However, the 27-year-old got traded to the Boston Bruins in 2015 for goaltender Martin Jones.</p><p>After that, Kuraly played for his college team for another year before making his professional debut with Boston’s AHL affiliate team, the Providence Bruins.</p><p>Subsequently, the Ohio native played one season for the franchise in which he scored 14 goals, 26 points, and assisted 12 times.</p><p>Thus having performed brilliantly, Sean was recalled to the Boston Bruins at the end of the 2016-17 season.</p><p>Thereafter, the 6 feet 2 centres made his debut against Tampa Bay Lightning in 2016, which they won in a 4-3 shootout victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kuraly-1014.jpg><p>Then, Kuraly’s first two career goals in the NHL came against Ottawa Senators in 2017.

At least that’s what a 27-year-old is portraying because he has not come out and announced his relationship publicly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sean-kuraly.38-172x300.png><p>However, it does not mean that Sean has never been in love.
