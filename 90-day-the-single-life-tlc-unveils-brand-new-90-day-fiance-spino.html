Though we do not yet have a full trailer, here is what we do know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fernanda was a young adult in her late teens when she met Jonathan Rivera, who was on vacation and clubbing in Mexico City.</p><p>The two hotties hit it off almost instantly, and Jon extended his vacation to spend more time with her. Despite the age gap, they opted to marry.</p><p>But Fernanda was unhappy with their life in the US, and was specifically unhappy with how her new husband treated her after they married. They had a bitter divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fernanda is still in the United States, living in Chicago where she has been seen working as a high end server and as a model.</p><p>Despite her heartbreak, she eventually moved on and began to try dating — over Zoom, as the COVID-19 pandemic had begun.</p><p>It will be amazing to see what this young woman gets up to, but some haters will not exactly be rooting for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Speaking of&nbsp;90 Day Fiance&nbsp;stars who have a lot of haters, Brittany Banks dated Yazan Abo Horira for years before they were filmed.</p><p>Unfortunately, being on camera changed so much about Yazan’s behavior — out of a desire to please his parents and fear of his extended family, he acted like a different person.</p><p>Viewers saw very little love in their story. Instead, they showed Yazan’s lies catching up with him as Brittany and his family realized that he had not been honest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Brittany clearly has a lot of hard feelings towards the man whom she was once prepared to marry.</p><p>As a model and a rapper, she’s going to have plenty of options as she tries to move on.</p><p>But fans will be curious to see how her experience with Yazan alters how she views life as a single lady and as she tries out dating again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Molly Hopkins is part of a set of Georgian women who fell in love with much younger men from other countries.</p><p>In her case, she was with Luis Mendez. It was a toxic marriage, it was short, and it ended quickly.</p><p>In fact, just a few months later, Luis remarried … which raised a lot of questions and eyebrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Since then, Molly has endeared herself to fans and viewers on&nbsp;Pillow Talk.</p><p>Fans are wondering what sort of life she is leading these days when she’s not sharing her opinion on other stars.</p><p>Will her next dates be age-appropriate? Or is she once again dipping her toes into much younger waters?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Colt Johnson is one of&nbsp;90 Day Fiance‘s most notorious villains, and cameras have followed his antics with two different women.</p><p>With both Larissa Lima and Jess Caroline, Colt was quick to try to blame his mother, Debbie, for his doomed relationships.</p><p>We might humbly suggest that perhaps the alleged mind games and the cheating had more to do with it than any MIL issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>What is interesting about Colt joining this show is that we already know how he moved on after Jess.</p><p>First, he was with a very beautiful Mexican woman … on whom he reportedly cheated with Vanessa. Then, he was with Vanessa.</p><p>Which part of Colt’s story will this follow? We don’t know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Danielle Mullins is one of the stars who put the franchise on the map. Her marriage to Mohamed Jbali was must-watch television.</p><p>They were both using each other. Danielle wanted a young lover. Mohamed wanted to come to America. They both got what they deserved — each other.</p><p>Obviously, it ended in disaster, with Mohamed accusing Danielle of having a genital odor and Danielle trying to get Mohamed deported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>These days, she and Mohamed are actually friendly — but are not at all interested in remarrying.</p><p>Danielle has moved on and is dating again, but fans are curious about (and suspicious of) which colorful characters are drawn to date such an eccentric personality.</p><p>Speaking of colorful characters …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Big Ed Brown is another 90 Day Fiance villain, who has been justifiably skewered by fans for his abhorrent treatment of Rosemarie Vega.</p><p>The guy is a creep.</p><p>But he is also one of the most memed reality stars on the planet, which is saying a lot when you’re talking about someone who was totally unknown before 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This means that, contrary to previous fan speculation, Big Ed has not been banned from all 90 Day Fiance spinoffs despite his gross behavior and a serious allegation of sexual assault.</p><p>Why? Because TLC loves money. Unless advertisers pull out or there’s a concentrated fan boycott, they’ll err on the side of filming a famous dumbass so long as he makes them money.</p><p>90 Day Fiance blogger John Yates was the first to break the news over the summer that Ed was filming again, so now we know that backstory.</p><a href=#><img width=1033 height=798 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/lisa-hamme-explains.png alt="Lisa Hamme Explains" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance Racist?
