I was super critical on that survey, but also very professional," Alex says in the TikTok.</p><p>The next day, Alex said his manager wanted to meet up with him pertaining to his comments in the survey, to which Alex responded that he thought the results of it were supposed to be "anonymous," as the email indicated.</p><p>His manager revealed that the word "anonymous" was a lie and that employees' responses were still tracked.</p><p>"My manager tried for a solid two and a half weeks to get this meeting with me.

So I get an email from my manager saying, 'hey do this anonymous survey about what you don't like about work.' And you know here's the thing, I was super critical on that survey, but I was also very professional."</p><p>He continues, "And then the very next day my manager comes up to me and says hey let's have a meeting about that survey. And I was like, um, no thank you and also I thought that was anonymous by the way. And she just flat out told me, 'yeah no they can still track you. And the chief nursing officer wants to talk to you as well.'"</p><p>He goes on to say, "Nope, I am not gonna meet you for this meeting. I'm not gonna do it.

Some cautioned to "never" trust "anonymous" work surveys as they're a setup and upper management almost always knows who is writing what. Others wanted to know what the survey entailed, which, according to Alex in the comments section: "I mentioned we shouldn’t be double rooming oncology patients with other kids who are RSV and flu pos," which sounds like a valid concern.</p><p>Others said that this kind of treatment of nurses is indicative of why so many "are leaving in droves."</p><p>"If you got “wrote up” it’s time to leave… nurse here of 16y and that’s how they start a paper trail. Second contact a workplace lawyer retaliation."</p><p>"Obviously they DO track you. Now you know anything that comes from ‘work’ is NEVER anonymous. It helps them cull any ‘trouble makers’"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nurse.alexrn</span></figure><p>"Not without my union rep!"</p><p>"I never believe them when they say it’s 'anonymous'"</p><p>"What survey? It was anonymous? I didn’t do the survey."</p><p>"This happened to me too. Smh never again have I done their surveys"</p><p>Others said that his manager may have been using workplace discrimination in order to find out who was posting what responses to the survey:</p><p>"Those surveys often ask basic demographic info: if you’re in a small unit they can figure it out. This is quite possibly discrimination."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nurse.alexrn</span></figure><p>Getting fired for expressing candid opinions in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"anonymous" surveys is nothing new, unfortunately</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SHRM</a> says that workplaces use a variety of methods in isolating who responded to what in an "anonymous" survey: "Even when an employer promises anonymity, the details that such surveys ask of respondents—the department in which they work, their title, their salary level, their years of service—can be enough to let any company know who responded and how."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo8Kzv8RmmKennq66sMHSZq6oqptiwLa%2B1Z6w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./newcastle-chaos-lascelles-row-hayden-spurs.html><span>←</span><span>Newcastle chaos continues as 'furious Jamaal Lascelles held back amid blazing row with Isaac Hayden</span></a>
