But the hangover was rough and outweighed the shovel. Ketamine was not for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The toxicology report from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner officially listed “acute effects of ketamine” as Matthew’s cause of death.

His death was ultimately ruled an accident.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Family, friends, and fans were shocked when Matthew <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was found unresponsive</a> at his Los Angeles, CA home on October 28. His cause of death was initially “deferred” due to the pending toxicology report and further investigation was requested. The Friends star was open about his struggles with alcohol and pills over the years and was reportedly “clean” for 19 months at the time of his death.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“You can track the trajectory of my addiction if you gauge my weight from season to season — when I’m carrying weight, it’s alcohol; when I’m skinny, it’s pills,” he wrote about his time on Friends. “When I have a goatee, it’s lots of pills.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BvZqaZpKm1psOMqZyrqqlixLO7055kpJ2klrqqusRmmainm2Kxpq3ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laura-mercier-19601002-html.html><span>←</span><span>Laura Mercier (Makeup Artist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
