I love to go to dinner at Catch, that’s our favorite restaurant. Love that place,” he said at the time. “Or just make a special night where we’re on the road. Go someplace and have her find a great restaurant that she really wants to go to. Or something like going to The Nutcracker with the kids. Whatever it is to get out.”</p><p>Their relationship came just two months after his ex-wife <strong>Kimberly Quaid</strong> filed for divorce from the Parent Trap star, who she wed in 2004. The exes share 8-year-old twins, Thomas and Zoe.</p><p>“After careful consideration, we have decided to end our 12-year marriage,” the pair said in a joint statement in June 2016. “The decision was made amicably and with mutual respect toward one another.
