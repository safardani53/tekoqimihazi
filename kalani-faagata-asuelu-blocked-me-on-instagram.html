Not exactly a positive sign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/asuelu-pulaa-and-kalani-faagata-on-90-day-diaries-1024x576.png><p>This week, Kalani took to her Instagram Story to call out her immature husband.</p><p>"Mr. BooHole blocked me," she wrote in a matter-of-fact yet mocking tone. Sure enough, Asuelu no longer follows her or her sister, Kolini.</p><p>Kalani acknowledged that former castmate Larissa Lima seemed to have blocked her, joking "that actually hurt myf eelings LMAOOO."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/larissa-lima-says-who-is-against-the-queen-will-die.gif><p>While we cannot speak to any recent drama between Kalani and the self-styled queen, fans are already speculating about Kalani and Asuelu.</p><p>The timing seems to be a little too coincidental to be, well, mere happenstance.</p><p>Fans think that it’s most likely that tensions boiled over for Kalani and Asuelu after they, and those closest to them, watched 90 Day Diaries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>(No, this was not a moment of stunning self-awareness on Asuelu’s part — he was describing how Kalani portrays him)</p><p>Discovery Plus viewers have already seen that Kalani and Asuelu had a very familiar vibe.</p><p>Things were tense. They both seemed totally drained. They acted like worn out roommates waiting for the lease the run out, not like husband and wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Asuelu, however, told his wife that he felt that things were generally "good."</p><p>Kalani disagreed.</p><p>She also noted that perhaps he feels differently because they are not shouldering the same burden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Asuelu, she noted, gets to leave the house and have time when he is completely alone.</p><p>Kalani does not have that luxury.</p><p>When her mom is not there to provide childcare assistance, Kalani is watching both of their sons. All day, every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Asuelu protested, claiming that he is making sacrifices because "plays golf" and does it "early."</p><p>He also said that he no longer plays volleyball, having switched to golf to appease her.</p><p>(Infamously, Asuelu began ignoring lockdown very early into the COVID-19 pandemic, endangering his family and Kalani’s, another wedge in their marriage)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Asuelu also said that there were times when he wanted to take Oliver to play golf with him, but that she had declined.</p><p>Why? Because Kalani described having seen Asuelu’s poor choices lead to near-disaster for their kids in the past.</p><p>She didn’t trust him to take Oliver to the driving range or anywhere else because he hasn’t shown that he can be responsible on his own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This is, frankly, an untenable situation.</p><p>Kalani is basically being a parent to three children.</p><p>That’s no way to treat your spouse, but Asuelu also refuses to act mature enough for her to not treat him this way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It’s almost like these two are fundamentally incompatible and are only together because a fun vacation hookup resulted in a pregnancy.</p><p>(It is literally exactly like that — a vacation fling, a pregnancy, and cultural and religious expectations pushed them to marry and stay that way)</p><p>Until Kalani and Asuelu are ready to split (unless he magically matures overnight), they’ll both continue to stew in misery. Well, mostly Kalani.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcLfApZinoV2brqKzwK2YZpmjqrKtwYybo6ibm5qxbrnEZqanZZmjwLWtxquYpmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-josiah-bell-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Josiah Bell Dating Now</span></a>
