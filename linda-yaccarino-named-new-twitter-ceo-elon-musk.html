Musk wrote, appropriately enough, on Twitter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology," added the billionaire. "Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The news came just hours after Musk shared he had "hired a new CEO."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She will be starting in ~ 6 weeks!" he added in a social media post, without sharing any additional information.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Musk first <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>promised to step down as Twitter CEO</a> in December, two months after paying $44 billion for the social media platform — and posting a poll in which he asked, "Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of the poll."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He later shared that 57.5 percent of people voted yes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In response, he tweeted: "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>I will resign as CEO</a> as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In considering the options for a new CEO, Musk previously said that person "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>must like pain a lot</a>" to run a business that "has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Elon Musk Buys Twitter for $44B Following Legal Battle with Company, Fires Top Execs: Reports</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yaccarino's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>departure from NBCUniversal</a> was also announced on Friday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"NBCUniversal today announced that Linda Yaccarino is leaving the company, effective immediately," they said in a statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team," Yaccarino said in a statement. "We've transformed our company and the entire industry—and I am so proud of what we've accomplished together, and grateful to my colleagues and mentors, especially Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and the entire NBCU leadership team."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yaccarino worked at NBCUniversal for over 11 years, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CNN</a>. She also started her career there as a college intern, returning to the company after serving as executive vice president/COO of advertising sales, marketing and acquisitions at Turner Broadcasting.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Linda Yaccarino.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Isaac Brekken/Variety/Penske Media via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before joining Twitter, the media <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>executive interviewed Musk</a> at a marking event in April.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We can all agree … this freedom of speech, deserves a bit more reach," Yaccarino wrote on Twitter at the time alongside a link to video of their conversation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In response, Musk simply replied, "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Thanks for having me</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Musk's time as Twitter CEO began when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>carried a kitchen sink</a> into San Francisco headquarters. Claims that he wasn't even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>paying the rent</a> at the office building were also made amid an epic tenure that was marred from the start by a mass exodus of thousands of employees who left by their own will or were forced out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Users who once gravitated to the forum for its reputation as an egalitarian coffee house became increasingly alienated, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>some accounts were deactivated by the businessman for challenging him</a>. Musk defended his actions, even though they were widely seen as anti-free speech.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since purchasing Twitter, the company has reportedly struggled with advertisers, with Musk himself saying last year there had been a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>massive drop in revenue</a>" as companies paused paying for ads. Many online have posited that Yaccarino's hiring shows Musk is committed to remedy the ad situation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yaccarino has yet to publicly comment on the news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8uipZ2ZXa6upK%2FAq6Cnp12jrq6xw2alnq9dqcSqwNOeqWablaR6prjOp2SmraOgfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-de-la-paz.html><span>←</span><span>Danny De La Paz</span></a>
