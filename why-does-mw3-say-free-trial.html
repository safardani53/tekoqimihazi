Many players have noticed that the game now says "Free Trial" in the start menu.

If you've been on the fence about checking out the newest game in the series, then worry not. Activision is giving gamers a chance to try out the game for free before buying.</p><p>In mid-December 2023, an official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> confirmed that MWIII would be offering a Free Access period for the holidays. The event runs from Dec. 14 to Dec. 18, meaning new players can dive in for the weekend and check out everything that the game has to offer.</p><p>Players are able to check out all of the game's multiplayer content, including maps, War Mode, and the Modern Warfare Zombies co-op mode.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Anyone accessing the free trial will also be able to access four different multiplayer modes: Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, and Domination.</p><p>Existing players will have likely noticed the "Free Access" tab that appears in the main menu during this trial. Obviously, none of this particularly matters if you already have the game, and your current playthroughs won't be affected. However, you can expect an influx of newcomers testing the waters of MWIII.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, there's good news and bad news to go with this free trial.

All of the content and experience you've earned in that installment will be carried over to the new Modern Warfare III.</p><p>With this robust trial featuring many of the hallmarks that COD is known for, there's no reason for fans of the franchise not to check out the game during this free trial.</p><p>The Free Access period for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III ends on Dec. 18 at 7 a.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlnayAbr%2FAsmSfqpWaerW%2ByJqj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-alicia-menendez-husband-carlos-prio-odio-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Alicia Menendez's husband, Carlos Pro Odio?</span></a>
