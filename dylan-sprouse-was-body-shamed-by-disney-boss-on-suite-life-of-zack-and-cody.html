It was like in the middle of a chunk of dialogue, so he kept skipping this laugh line,” she said. “And finally we get in front of the studio audience and he skips it, and the executive producer screams, ‘Cut! Dylan, say the line!’ And he goes, ‘I would not disrespect any woman that way, let alone this woman. You write something funny and I’ll say it.’ “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5JpZp2xnJa7br%2FPq6auq5VixKK%2FjJumnbFdqLWiucSdZJuxXZm2tLrEsmSbp6OoerC6jKysoqyVYrmqssRmpp9lqpawrHnAp5tmm5%2BZxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./talia-joy-castellano-cancer-death-family-friends-twitter.html><span>←</span><span>Cancer Patients Brave Last Days With Family &amp;amp; Friends Hollywood Life</span></a>
