However, Sting’s real name is<strong> Steve Borden</strong>, and he was born in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Likewise, he was born on March 20, 1959, and currently, Sting is 64 years old.</p><p>However, not many details have been found about his childhood and parents.</p><p>Sting’s household was quite entertaining and enjoyable as he shared his childhood with his brother Jeff Borden. He, along with his brother, had an average yet amazing childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Sting started his career very young, and he was almost fifteen years old when he started his career. Since then, the wrestler has not looked back, and Sting is still strong and fighting.</p><p>So it seems a bit surprising to know that a man of Sting’s status and popularity never had involvement in other things apart from wrestling.</p><p>However, Sting has gone to university, which means he is also focused on his education. But he had to start fighting from an early age because he lived an average life, and he wanted to make his and his family’s life happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Red Bastien and Rick Bassman trained Sting to be a better wrestler. Similarly, Sting made his wrestling debut in 1985, November 1.</p><h2>Sting Net Worth | Career Earnings: Wrestling, Movie, Video Games, and Endorsements</h2><p>Choosing wrestling as a career is a tough decision because sometimes things may turn really worse, and it is as difficult as any profession. Wrestling definitely looks like jacked guys beating one another to a pulp, but it’s not.</p><p>Likewise, one has to be properly trained, coordinated, and absolutely experienced. That is the only way you can earn more money in wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>With thousands of audiences, the wrestling arena is stocked for every pay-per-view. Therefore, the cash inflow isn’t that difficult.

However, many other wrestlers were taller than Sting, but he always successfully managed to showcase his talent.</p><p>Sting was the headline of every show as he was loved and appreciated by most of his audience. Likewise, his face paint was one of those things which were attracting his audience towards him.</p><p>Everyone was curious to see the face behind the face paint, and Sting successfully managed to keep the suspense for very long.</p><h3>Further,</h3><p>Sting’s performance inside the ring was flawless and smooth, which may be why he was gaining love from the audience.</p><p>Similarly, by the end of his almost five decades-long careers, Sting has successfully garnered a net worth of <strong>$8 million</strong> from the regular salary alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Undoubtedly, the audience was fortunate enough to have witnessed the Sting in action more and more since the dawn of the 90s.

Furthermore, Steve’s secondary source of income is through merchandise deals. Out of which, 3% of the revenue generated finds its way into Steve’s pocket.</p><p>Apart from that, sting’s viewer’s rating originated throughout the decade, making him one of the most desired-after wrestlers. Accordingly, Sting should receive the credit for making WWE a worldwide craze.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from wrestling, Steve delved into business and founded an organization named “Borden Media Consulting.” Similarly, this company specializes in high-level management consulting.</p><h3>Steve Net Worth: Movies</h3><p>Furthur, Steve would also add to his net worth through acting.
