who played Mick 'Crocodile' Dundee - was <a href=#>pictured in a rare public appearance</a> after leaving an angry note to homeless people camping outside his mansion in Venice, Los Angeles.</p><p>The letter, which the actor denied writing, was pinned to the gates of the £2.86million pad and read: “THIS IS <span>MY HOME</span> NOT YOURS.”</p><p>It came as a surprise to fans who thought the Aussie, 82, was like his laid-back Crocodile Dundee character - but it's not the only shocking story to emerge about the cast.&nbsp;</p><p>From a tumultuous co-star affair to stars charged with a range of offences including tax evasion allegations and assault, we reveal the scandals behind the Down Under drama.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE STORIES">READ MORE STORIES</h2><h2>Linda Kozlowski - Affair before fury over career flop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000753085390.jpg><p>In the film, she played reporter Sue Charlton, who was tasked with profiling Mick Dundee before unexpectedly falling in love with him.</p><p>And it was a case of art imitating life, as Linda Kozlowski fell for co-star Paul while they were filming together - an affair that rocked his marriage.</p><p>The couple, who had a 19-year age gap, later tied the knot in 1990 and had one son together Chance, now 24, before getting divorced in 2014.</p><p>Linda’s performance in Crocodile Dundee earned her a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress, but after that, she struggled to land big parts and quit acting to be a mother.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>In 2001, she told the Herald Journal: “These straight-to-video, schlocky films I was getting were giving me an ulcer basically because I was the only one on the set that cared about anything.”</p><p>Since then, Linda, 64, has been with Moroccan tour guide Moulay Hafid Baba and splits her time between Marrakesh and Los Angeles.</p><h2>Paul Hogan - 'Tax evasion' battle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cbff9948-b1f4-4545-bcde-852c52cc1902-1.jpg><p>Before his turn as Crocodile Dundee, Paul shot to fame in the Aussie talent show New Faces, where he performed as a tapdancing knife thrower.&nbsp;</p><p>The 82-year-old has been married three times - twice to Nolene Edwards, mother of five of his children, and when they split it was described as Australia’s ugliest celebrity divorce.</p><p>It followed his fling with co-star Linda, who he was married to until 2014 when they cited “irreconcilable differences” and having nothing in common while getting divorced.</p><p>Paul’s career led to him appearing in an advert for Fosters beer, play Porter in Flipper and continuing the Crocodile Dundee franchise.</p><p>For seven years from 2003, he was investigated for tax evasion and fraud in Australia and America before being finally cleared.</p><p>The cases were dropped and Paul, who received an undisclosed payout from the government, later joked: "I did them like a dinner."</p><p>Paul tends to keep a low profile - apart from his recent outing this week - but two years ago, appeared in The Very Excellent Mr Dundee.&nbsp;</p><h2>Steve Rackman - Became gym instructor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000753085466.jpg><p>Prior to playing ‘Donk’, Steve Rackman was a wrestler who used the name ‘Crusher’, and famously fought Andre the Giant before a 10,000-strong crowd.&nbsp;</p><p>After appearing in three Crocodile Dundee films, the actor stepped away from the limelight and opened several gyms, which he sold to retire in 2010.</p><h2>Caitlin Clarke -

he struggled with <a href=#>alcoholism</a> and had several police incidents.</p><p>In 2006, David was charged with carrying an offensive weapon after drawing a machete during an altercation but was later cleared as the blade was deemed useful for cultural purposes.</p><p>After a 12-month prison stint for breaking his wife's arm by throwing a broom at her, he went sober.
