But the decidedly stripped back song and accompanying music video was a chance for the members to share a new side of themselves, they tell PEOPLE.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's about our doubt or anxiety, that feeling growing inside us,” says Yeji, 23.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Lia, 23, “We always talk about trusting in ourselves and loving ourselves, but this time it's more fighting your inner fear and overcoming that.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Itzy.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JYP Entertainment</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The members — which also includes Ryujin, 22, Chaeryeong, 22, and Yuna, 19 —&nbsp;eschew their bolder public personas for ordinary clothes and everyday settings as they rap and sing about feelings of isolation and loneliness over a driving beat. Ultimately the track is about empowerment, whether that’s being OK with your bad days or finding strength to overcome them.<br></p><p></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But it’s not all stoic introspection on Kill My Doubt.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Far from it, the main single “Cake,” the video for which also debuted Monday, is just the opposite: an upbeat anthem giving permission to enjoy life and worry a little less. The members chant “It’s a piece of cake cake cake,” in English even as everything imaginable goes awry in the music video (top) — from collapsing sets, shoot outs and explosions to literal demons trying to throw shade.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You can’t make everyone happy. Show some respect. I do me, you do you,” they sing in Korean while showing off new choreography —&nbsp;something they’re well known for among their fans, known collectively as Midzy (a romanization of the Korean word for "trust").&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“None of My Business,” the second pre-release track is similarly unbothered: a chilled out kiss off to a messy relationship. The mini album is rounded out by three more songs: “Bratty,” “Psychic Lover” and “Kill Shot.” &nbsp;</p><p></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For all the variety of genres tapped into for this album, one thing Midzy knows not to expect from Itzy — and something that has made them resonate with many international fans outside the world of K-pop — is their cool, un-stuffy concepts, often labeled "girl crush" in the industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of ultra-feminine styling and sweet public personas of earlier idols, the members instead embody the best friend fans wish they had.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Asked to define the concept, Lia explains, "Beforehand, I think lots of girl groups would do more lovely or cute or girly moods. But these days we're kind of getting more sporty and some hip-hop mixed in the music."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Itzy.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JYP Entertainment</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A closeness and relatability to their fans is something the members cherish, even sharing their nerves ahead of a big release like Kill My Doubt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to PEOPLE earlier this month, Yeji shared the number one thing they're looking forward to about getting this album out in the world was seeing "our fans' reactions."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The group debuted in 2019, shortly before the pandemic and, like so many acts of the same generation, spent the beginning of their career isolated from those supporting them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Four years in, they say, they still feel nerves releasing something new. "I think because we take a lot of care for one album and there is so many people's effort and hard work [in it], so we are always nervous before we show up," says Ryujin.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Itzy.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JYP Entertainment</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We can definitely feel their excitement. And at the same time, we get that feeling that our fans are also kind of nervous," says Lia, who admits, "For me personally, I check Twitter a lot every time, when we release anything."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the group have already landed plenty of accolades. Their sixth EP, Cheshire, which they toured the U.S. in support of last year, landed at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and they've steadily been making a name for themselves with U.S. viewers on programs like MTV's Fresh Out and and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show Me Music."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the members, they just hope to reach as many fans as possible in Korea and far beyond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We don't have any specific targeted goals," says Chaeryeong, "but we just want more and more people to get into Itzy [and have our] summer songs recognized world wide."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kill My Doubt is available to stream now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5mpx7p5zqmcp2WlpXqirs6uq2amlax6orjBrqRmo5mhuW652GabqK2SqXqmxMKlrKyhppp6eIGVcHBxaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hayden-fluellen-rky5-html.html><span>←</span><span>Hayden Fluellen (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
