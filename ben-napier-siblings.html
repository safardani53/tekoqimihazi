Erin said he hated school and “always wanted to see the world from behind the wheel of a Peterbilt [truck].” He and Ben also “talk on the phone every day like girls,” she wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>And Jesse is the “crazy polite” and introspective brother who enjoys thinking and discussing politics and sociological topics, Erin observed. “He’s not naturally social, but you’d never guess it,” she added.</p><p>As for her husband, Erin said Ben is “even-tempered” and “fearless in social situations.” He enjoys making and fixing things — as Home Town viewers can certainly attest — but he’s also into music and books.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The HGTV star also revealed that Sam married a redhead, Tom married a brunette, and Ben — of course — married a blonde. (At the time, Jesse was a bachelor. “Who knows who he will marry?” wrote Erin.)</p><p>But Erin also discussed the commonalities between the brothers: “They all love cars, Duke basketball, and believe their father is the smartest, toughest, wisest, coolest man on earth.

At the time, however, Ben had spent the prior year dropping 60 pounds after a doctor gave him a dire warning.</p><p>“I was really worried about Ben because we have heart disease in my family, it is a genetic thing,” Wayne added, saying he himself had a triple bypass surgery in 2014.</p><p>Apparently, all four boys were more conscious of their health at the time. “I had my warning, and I’m delighted that Ben and my other sons have been paying attention to their blood pressure and weight because it is very important,” Wayne told the site. “I love all my sons and I am proud of what Ben has achieved — we just want to make sure that he is around a long time for his family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7Kvec2ap6KdomLAqq7LoqWgqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cleaning-fan-filthy-tanning-mitt-easy-steps.html><span>←</span><span>Cleaning fan gets her filthy tanning mitt looking as good as new in three easy steps</span></a>
