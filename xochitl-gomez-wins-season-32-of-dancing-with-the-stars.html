<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Xochitl Gomez Wins Season 32 of 'Dancing With the Stars</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Xochitl Gomez</strong> and partner <a href=#><strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong></a> became the first pair to win <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>’ Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy during the Tuesday, December 5, season 32 finale.</p><p>“Oh my god, there’s so much confetti,” Gomez, 18, exclaimed as she cried tears of joy. This is the third time Chmerkovskiy, 37, took home the win as a pro on the ABC series.</p><p>DWTS’ grand prize was <a href=#>renamed to honor Goodman</a> in September. Goodman, who <a href=#>died at age 78</a> in April, served as a judge on the reality competition series from 2005 to 2022.</p><p>Before the winners of the coveted prize were announced, the five final couples each took the stage twice. The duos performed both a freestyle and a redemption routine, the latter of which allowed the pros another go at a dance they struggled with earlier in the season.</p><p><strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong> and partner <strong>Sasha Farber</strong> tried their hand at redemption first, performing a salsa to “Get on Your Feet” by <strong>Gloria Estefan</strong>. Judge <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong> told Hannigan, 49, that she wanted to see her bring more sex appeal to the dance this time around.</p><p>“You did an amazing job. Something is so different about you,” Inaba, 55, told the actress after the performance. “You are a different person than the person who walked in on that very first episode. You have grace, you have confidence now.”</p><p><strong>Jason Mraz</strong>, meanwhile, was tasked with a foxtrot for the redemption round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Xochitl-Gomez-and-Val-Chmerkovskiy-Who-Went-Home-During-Dancing-With-the-Stars-Whitney-Houston-Night-1.jpg><p>“The first time he performed [the foxtrot], he had some problems because the frame was very tight,” <strong>Bruno Tonioli</strong> said to cameras before telling Mraz, 46, that he looked like he was “carrying a sack of potatoes” during rehearsal.</p><p>However, Mraz and partner <strong>Daniella Karagach</strong>’s practice paid off and the pair earned a perfect score.</p><p>“Pure classic ballroom foxtrot,” Tonioli, 68, said, praising the “old school Hollywood leading man” flavor that Mraz brought to the dance.</p><p>Karagach, 30, broke down in tears while listening to the judges’ feedback and proceeded to gush about Mraz to cohost <strong>Julianne Hough</strong>.</p><p>“I’m just so proud of him, the human being that he is,” Karagach said. “Week 4 was a struggle for us and the fact you were <a href=#>able to push through</a> and be in this final so open heartedly and just want it so bad is just so refreshing.”</p><p><strong>Ariana Madix</strong> also impressed the judges with her samba, which <strong>Derek Hough</strong> wanted her to attempt again so she could “slow it down” and show off the “lines and control” that characterize the dance.</p><p>“Giving you the samba in a finale is mean, but Ariana, you’re a samba queen!” Hough, 38, gushed after the performance, giving Madix, 38, a standing ovation.</p><p>One finalist, however, received some criticism after her redemption dance. Although Inaba praised “the passion and connection” between <strong>Charity Lawson</strong> and partner <strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong> that she was missing during their first tango, she said she “had to call out” a mistake in the choreography.</p><p>Despite Inaba’s critique, Hough called Lawson’s tango “the best dance of the night so far.”</p><p>Last but not least, Gomez and Chmerkovskiy danced a foxtrot. Tonioli told Gomez that she “lost balance” the first time she attempted the dance and “hit it so cleanly” that her arm movements weren’t as elegant as they should’ve been.</p><p>After the performance, Tonioli was satisfied. “Your musicality is like part of the orchestra,” he told Gomez. “It really is a delight watching you.”</p><p>The finalists weren’t the only ones who performed during the finale; all the previously eliminated season 32 couples returned for an opening number set to “Young Hearts Run Free” by <strong>Candi Staton</strong> as well as a jive to “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” by <strong>Mariah Carey</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last season’s champions, <strong>Charli D’Amelio</strong> and <strong>Mark Ballas</strong>, also showed their stuff during the episode, performing a routine set to “Give It To Me Baby” by Rick James.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all the performers’ scores from the season 32 finale:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BtvKS0yK2jZp%2BforK7edaipaxlo5qutLvNZmprZZ%2BbeqWtzZygp59drLa1tIytn55lo6mus7%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fox-sandra-smiths-husband-john-conolly.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Sandra Smith's husband John Conolly?</span></a>
