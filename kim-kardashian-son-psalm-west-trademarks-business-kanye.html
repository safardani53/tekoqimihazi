anti-inflammatory ointments; baby food; infant formula."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Kim Kardashian">Read More on Kim Kardashian</h2><p>Psalm's third trademark contains: "Strollers;

entertainment" and more.</p><p>The sixth trademark states Psalm's business future could include "baby carriers worn on the body; all-purpose carrying bags; backpacks; handbags; tote bags; purses; wallets; bags for carrying babies' accessories; diaper bags" and more.</p><p>Psalm's seventh trademark branches out into "furniture; cribs; baby bouncers; baby changing mats; baby walkers; mattresses; cushions; nursing pillows; foot stools; mirrors" and more.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Similarly, the eighth filing states: "Textiles for home furnishings, namely, household linens, bath linens, bed linens, kitchen linens, and table linens; drapery; afghans; throws; comforters; bed blankets; baby bedding, namely, swaddling blankets, crib bumpers" and more.</p><p>However, Kim's ninth trademark for her son includes various clothing items such as "coats;

endorsement services" and "entertainment in the nature of providing information by means of a global computer network in the fields of entertainment and pop culture; entertainment services, namely, personal appearances by a celebrity."</p><p>Psalm's last trademarks were all filed in 2019, so it looks like the young toddler was due for a fresh update of permit applications.</p><h2>NEXT JENNER-ATION</h2><p>The entire Kar-Jenner clan has been following Kim's footsteps and The U.S. Sun previously reported on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Kardashian</a>&nbsp;family's big plans for their&nbsp;<a href=#>kids to take over their $3billion empire</a>.</p><p>The Kardashian-Jenners are setting their children up to take over the empire, as the stars have&nbsp;<a href=#>filed various trademarks for their children</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, Kim filed more&nbsp;<a href=#>trademarks for Chicago and Saint</a>&nbsp;to launch skincare, toy and fashion brands.</p><p>The Sun previously reported&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim</a>&nbsp;acquired the nine distinct trademarks for&nbsp;<a href=#>her two middle children</a>&nbsp;on July 26, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;skin services&nbsp;trademark covers everything from skin moisturizers, lotions, bath and shower gels; bubble baths and powders, and cosmetics, to fragrances and even nail polish.</p><p>The trademarks for toys cover a wide range of product possibilities including toy figures, dolls, infant toys, mechanical action toys, bath toys, toy jewelry and much more.</p><p>For the clothing, the trademark applies to everything from "Bottoms as clothing; coats; dresses; footwear; headwear; jackets; jumpers; loungewear," and a slew of other products with bibs and costumes lumped in.</p><p>The trademark for advertising services is earmarked to promote the above various products, among other endorsement services.</p><p>Interestingly, Chicago has an additional trademark, which it appears Kim did not attempt to acquire for&nbsp;<a href=#>Saint</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Chicago</a>'s fifth filing is listed as: "Entertainment in the nature of providing information by means of a global computer network in the fields of entertainment and pop culture; entertainment services, namely, personal appearances by a celebrity."&nbsp;</p><p>Psalm appears to have the most trademarks out of all of Kim's children, with North and Chicago tying in second with five trademarks filed each as Saint has only four.</p><h2>OUT OF THIS WORLD!</h2><p>Kim's youngest sister, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, 25, appears to be taking her older sister's ideas as she filed three new trademarks for <a href=#>Stormi World</a> on August 24, 2022, after not touching the name since February 2019.</p><p>The first of the three trademarks are for "advertising and endorsement services" to "promote the goods and services of others."</p><p>It also describes "retail store services" including "gifts; general consumer merchandise; apparel; apparel accessories; toys; sporting goods; beauty products; cosmetics; skincare and fragrances."</p><p>The second trademark filed for Stormi World, details: "Toy figures; doll accessories; dolls; drawing toys; infant toys; mechanical action toys; electronic action toys; play sets for action figures and soft sculpture toys."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The extensive list continues on including "bath toys;
