Real Housewives of Orange County alum Meghan King smiled while Gina Kirschenheiter sat there and looked uncomfortable.

Come on over. I asked for a little one, but I guess, somebody got this one," the <a href=#>WWHL </a>host said.</p><p>All three of them lifted up the ski and drank their liquids.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON WWHL">READ MORE ON WWHL</h2><p>When they put it down, Andy grimaced and looked at Meghan asking: "I think mine was yours. What did you have?"</p><p>Meghan shrugged and said: "1942?"</p><p>"Ohh my God. Wow," Andy grimaced.</p><p>"What did you have?" Meghan asked.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"What was yours?" Andy asked her again, thinking he got hers.</p><p>"We'll be right back. I had the wrong shot."</p><p>But, the problem is that Gina is sober, so if a staffer mixed up Andy and Meghan's drinks, they might have mixed up Gina's too.</p><h2>'YIKES!'</h2><p>Fans took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to react to the shocking segment on the show.</p><p>"Yikes whoever messed up the shotski or whatever it’s called is about to get fired," wrote one fan.</p><p>"Imagine if Gina— who is sober— would have had alcohol in her glass. SMH."</p><p>A fan replied to them: "I was gagging. I saw the look on Gina's face when Andy announced the shotski. She was still sitting down at that point and her face was a mixed of fear and annoyance. I felt bad for her."</p><p>"I don’t think they should do the shot ski when sober people are guests on the show," another fan tweeted.</p><p>"Right. Maybe they will think about that after tonight," replied a Twitter user.</p><p>Someone quote-tweeted the original tweet, saying: "I’ve always thought that but didn’t want to be the sober party pooper but COME ON they almost mixed the shots up?!"</p><h2>GINA'S SOBRIETY JOURNEY</h2><p>In April, Gina revealed to <a aria-label="People (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that she is sober and how it changed her life.</p><p>"I can't begin to describe how much it's changed me," she told the outlet.</p><p>"Drinking was a big part of my life and to eliminate it was a huge shift for me personally. But it's had this trickle-down, ripple effect where I've just seen so many things shift for the better. And I couldn't be happier."</p><p>She decided to stop drinking over a year and a half ago.</p><p>Gina opened up about her sobriety journey on the fifth season of <a href=#>Real Housewives</a> of Orange County.</p><p>The reality TV star realized she was becoming too dependent on alcohol, so she decided to make the change.</p><p>"I was drinking way too much. What used to be a drink when I was out at night with friends became, especially during COVID, me pouring a drink every night without even thinking about it," Gina told People.</p><p>"And I don't identify as an alcoholic, I don't believe I have that disease. But I felt the scales starting to tip, and I didn't like that feeling. I was numbing myself with it. I was self-medicating, and I couldn't stop. It was more in control of me than I was of it."</p><p>She continued to say that when she thought she could stop, she would have a hard week, and pick up a drink.</p><p>Gina then realized it was serious.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The RHOC star stopped going out to social gatherings and eliminated all the alcohol from her house.</p><p>She focused on more daytime activities and time with her kids, which helped her stay sober.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/wwhl-host-andy-cohen-grimaces-831495848.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/wwhl-host-andy-cohen-grimaces-831495846.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/wwhl-host-andy-cohen-grimaces-831495842.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZW59doOPaK6woJxirq%2Bw2GaaqKCVo3qovsimmJydo2LGprjLrGSmmaOotrexjKWgr51dqcNursuupZ2domQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kris-jenner-why-shell-never-join-the-real-housewives-of-beverly.html><span>←</span><span>Why She'll Never Join The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</span></a>
