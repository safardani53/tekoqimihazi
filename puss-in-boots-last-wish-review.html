★★★★☆ AS a self-confessed cat woman, I can think of no better hero to lead a film than fearless feline Puss.
The delightfully daring kitty (Antonio Banderas), who first appeared in 2004’s outstanding Shrek 2, had his own spin-off film over a decade ago.
Now, the sequel sees the caped crusader living his best — and last — life.
Having pushed the boundaries of adventure for years, Puss discovers he is on his ninth life, having died eight times already."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

the sequel sees the caped crusader living his best — and last — life.</p><p>Having pushed the boundaries of adventure for years, Puss discovers he is on his ninth life, having died eight times already.</p><p>His previous departures are explained in a hilarious montage that is a great reminder of the chaotic cat’s character.</p><p>Resolved to stay alive, he decides to keep a low profile, so finds a comfortable little cat sanctuary in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>There he can grow a beard, eat disgusting dry cat food and avoid the bounty hunter wolf who is keen to get his dead body and claim a reward.</p><p>But he soon learns of a magical wishing star that could restore all of his lost lives.</p><p>And along with new friend Perrito (Harvey Guillen) — a dog who is dressed as a cat to enjoy the luxury of the sanctuary — and his old friend Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), they go on a mission to try to find it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Film</h2></p><p>The journey is a dangerous one, with entry into the black forest, and the trio are soon up against gangster family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, <a href=#>Olivia Colman</a> and Samson Kayo) who are also on a bid for the wishing star.</p><p>There’s also super villain Jack Horner (John Mulaney) who will stop at nothing to get his pie-covered thumbs on it.</p><p>The effects in this super-kitty movie are a spectacle, with some parent-friendly nods to Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill films.</p><p>There are some incredibly daring action sequences, and Horner and the bounty hunter wolf are both dreadful enough to keep you fearing for our furry friend’s life.</p><p>On a deeper level, it also highlights the shared fear of death — and losing loved ones — that unites all of us.</p><p>Banderas brings all the usual joy and energy to the character he made his own, and uses just the right amount of humour in the role, too.</p><p>It’s not as purrfect as Shrek 2, but it is still pretty paw-some.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>KNOCK AT THE CABIN</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>(15) 100mins</strong></p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p>DIRECTOR M Night Shyamalan is back on his psychological horror flex with this adaptation of novel The Cabin At The End Of The World.</p><p>Loving couple Andrew and Eric are vacationing with their adoptive daughter Wen at a secluded cabin when four armed strangers (led by <a href=#>Dave Bautista</a>’s Leonard) turn up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2018-novel-cabin-end-world-792360096.jpg><p>Tight pacing from the get-go maintains a nervy edge as these four individuals demand the family make a harrowing choice: Kill one of their family to prevent the apocalypse or let the world burn.</p><p>The slow-releasing story-line, with succinct flashback scenes, gives a gripping sense of who this family are and what hardships they have faced.</p><p>Paired with moving performances that capture a huge range of emotions, this is one of the rare Shyamalan films not to require a plot twist to succeed.</p><p>Just sharp, empathetic direction, acting and writing, which reminds you that he is a filmmaker who loves to play with good and bad, hero and villain and happiness and suffering to get audiences asking philosophical questions of themselves too.</p><ul><li>HANNA FLINT</li></ul><h2 class=has-text-align-center>THE WHALE</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>(15) 117mins</strong></p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★★</span></h2><p>THE opening scene of this Darren Aronofsky film shows a super-morbidly- obese man surrounded by debris in his dingy room, watching pornography that gives him a heart attack.</p><p>Even for the most open-minded viewer, it’s a pretty grotesque sight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lmk110-j8561-151122-supplied-lmkmedia-789636675.jpg><p>So it makes Brendan Fraser’s performance all the more remarkable that you not only don’t dislike him, you actually end up adoring him.</p><p>Fraser plays Charlie, a man living as a hermit, who pushes his eating addiction to extreme levels.</p><p>He’s a teacher of English, but only does this via Zoom, where he pretends his camera has broken so his students can never see him.</p><p>As Charlie is almost immobile, all of this drama is set in his small house where the blinds are mostly shut.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The only other characters are those who visit, including his friend Liz (Hong Chau) who is a nurse but also his enabler, his spiky estranged daughter, Ellie (<a href=#>Sadie Sink</a>), ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton) and missionary Thomas (Ty Simpkins).</p><p>But it’s Fraser who is the outright star of this masterful film, giving such a powerful performance that it will leave even the hardest heart broken.</p><p><h3
