In 2021, his breakup with Lana Rhoades broke the hearts of many fans who were rooting for Rhoades to be his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Fifth Vital's author has been doing what he has been doing the best—living his life to the fullest, enjoying his fame, and meeting new people. What's more, he has made lots of ladies jealous by joking&nbsp;about his relationship status and getting a girlfriend on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Youtube </a>and Twitter a couple of times. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>i also probably should get a girlfriend. — Mike Majlak (@mikemajlak) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 15, 2022</a></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That's why if one-day Majlak suddenly comes out on Instagram holding someone and proclaiming her his "girlfriend" in the caption, it would be hard to take such posts or&nbsp;content from him at its face value.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>What led to Lana Rhoades and Mike Majlak's&nbsp;breakup?</h2><p>The pair's relationship started in 2020 after Logan Paul played the role of an accidental cupid. Paul presented Rhoades as a<a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;birthday gift</a>&nbsp;to Majlak, and it was a prank. Eventually, the two lovebirds started dating.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In October 2021, the couple surprised fans as the reports of their possible separation were all up in the air amid&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>cheating allegations</a>&nbsp;against Majlak. Post the split, Majlak recalled their split was amicable.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Rhoades later blamed Majlak's behavior that he showcased during the second time the couple had decided to live together. On April 20, 2021, she disclosed to the&nbsp;BFF podcast with Dave Portnoy and Josh Richards that she was all in on Mike's moving in with her. "He told me he was going to move in with me," she shared. Sadly, she claimed he broke up with her instead of moving in. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After that, they again got back together, and according to Rhoades, Majlak was again supposed to move in the second time. Rhoades said she later got super angry when he decided not to join her and remain busy elsewhere. "I was like just get the [expletive] out of my house," she shared on the podcast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Why did Fans think Mike Majlak was&nbsp;Lana Rhoades’ Baby Daddy?</h2><p>In February 2021, American YouTuber and&nbsp;social media influencer&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Mike Majlak</a> broke the internet when he announced a breakup with his girlfriend, Lana Rhoades.</p><p>The American model took the internet by storm once again as she announced she was eight weeks pregnant on her Instagram on June 2, almost six months after her breakup with Majlak. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She broke the news when she&nbsp;posted the photograph of her sonogram alongside a medical report announcing her due date, January 13, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately after the pregnancy announcement, the hottest question search about&nbsp;Majlak went from "Who is Mike Majlak dating?" to "Is Mike Majlak the father of Rhoades' baby?"&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Majlak reveals he isn't the Baby Daddy</h2><p>Majlak addressed the whole situation during the&nbsp;June 3 episode of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">imPaulsive podcast</a>, where he said he had been receiving a lot of "Congratulations" messages. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"Never have I have ever before gotten this many messages in my life than in the last 24 hours." he admitted.
