He has been rumored to be in a romantic relationship with his topmost favorite fan, Ella Bonafede.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/With-his-girlfriend-Ella.jpg><p>They studied together at Duke University, and Ella was a long-time cheerleader for her only boyfriend.</p><p>Ella was born in Cleveland, Ohio but spent most of her life in Long Island, New York.

But there are no such updates. That pretty much sums up that things are sour between this couple.&nbsp;</p><p>And this apparently happened during the quarantine days.</p><p>Currently, we have no other information on the couple.</p><h2>Daniel Jones | Danny Dimes</h2><p>How did he receive his nickname “Danny Dimes”?</p><p>Okay, there is no such exciting reason behind this. He was given this nickname during the early start of his rookie year.</p><p>It just happened randomly. Here, dimes mean throwing a pass perfectly, and he was expected to do so.</p><p>And Danny was something that rhymed well with Daniel. Also, because of the alliteration.</p><p>Henceforth, Danny Dimes happened ahead of his rookie year. He was pretty okay with it. His teammate<a href=# rel=noopener> Alex Tanney</a> also supported his unique nickname.</p><p>Moreover, Daniel was called “Swag” in his early days at Charlotte Latin in North Carolina. And following that, he was nicknamed ” The Future” at Duke University.</p><h2>Daniel Jones Quotes</h2><p>“My focus is here, in the building, my teammates, coaches, and everyone a part of this organization, has been my focus.
