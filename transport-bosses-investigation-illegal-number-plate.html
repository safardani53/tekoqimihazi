Contact The Sun Online on 0207 782 4368 or e-mail richard.wheatstone@the-sun.co.uk</strong></p><p>Victims such as Richard Wise, 57, from Seaford, East Sussex, has been bombarded with fines and court summons for offences carried out in places he's never visited more than 100 miles from his home.</p><p>The granddad-of-three told The Sun Online: "It takes over your life. You just don't know what the next day is going to bring.</p><p>""You feel like you've lost control. You're being accused of things in places you've never even been and as soon as they've got a picture of your plate it's a case of guilty until proven innocent.</p><p>"I lived with my grandkids and I decided I had to go and rent somewhere else for their sakes. I didn't want bailiffs coming to the door when I was out and going through their home."</p><h2>CLONING PLATES AS QUICK AS ORDERING A TAKEAWAY</h2><p>The Sun Online found laws being flouted at one in four DVLA-registered plate suppliers we visited across London.</p><p>Laws were tightened in 2003 to force UK garages and shops supplying plates to register with the DVLA and check the photo ID and vehicle documents of customers.</p><p>Many of the suppliers we visited immediately asked for a driving licence and V5 log book and said we would need to return with the documents before the plates could be made.</p><p>But within seconds of walking into three outlets, without a vehicle, we handed over around Â£30 for plates to clone a car we didn't own without even showing ID.</p><p>Church Elm Motors in Dagenham, East London, had our cloned plates ready to collect within 90 minutes.</p><p>A member of staff initially said we would legally need to produce a log book, before adding: "(But) I can do it for you, it's not a problem".</p><p>We were only asked for a name and the make and model of the car before the order was passed on to a manufacturer over the phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AD-GRAPHIC-Car-Cloning-V3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AD-GRAPHIC-Car-Cloning-2.jpg><p>Southside Accident Repair Centre in Plumstead, South East London, had the plates ready to collect within three hours.</p><p>Our reporter wasn't asked for ID or the vehicle log book - only to write a name and address on a sheet of paper.</p><p>A member of staff told a colleague: "Just get his reg (number), yeah" after confirming a price for the plates.</p><p>CS Motors in Barking, East London, said we would need to present ID and a vehicle log book but it could order the plates and take payment without seeing them first.</p><p>We weren't asked for the documents when we returned for the plates six days later.</p><p>After being approached with our evidence, Southside ARC said "the matter is being dealt with internally" and declined to comment further.</p><p>CS Motors claimed that it didn't need to check ID or vehicle documents when a customer pays by debit card as that means a name has been kept on record.</p><p>The firm added that because it doesn't make the plates on site it is also not required to check documents. The DLVA said neither point is correct.</p><p>Church Elm Motors did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Sun Online was also able to legally purchase number plates designed to look UK road legal on overseas websites and have the plates delivered to our door.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><p>National Police Chiefsâ Council Lead for ANPR, Chief Constable Charlie Hall said: âDisplaying cloned number plates is a criminal act and will only be done with criminal motives in mind.</p><p>"The increased reporting of this crime can be attributed to the growth in detection technology and cameras, with more victims being alerted through the issue of fixed penalty notices for traffic contraventions.</p><p>"We do, however, still think cloning is considerably under-reported as victims will usually be unaware that their number plate has been cloned."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/KH-MUZZ-Richard-Wise3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493877890.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JH-NUMBER-PLATE-MUZZ-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493928737.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493878024.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JH-NUMBER-PLATE-MUZZ-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493929207.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AD-PIC-Face-Muzz2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493443911.jpg><br><p><b><span class=il>We</span>&nbsp;<span class=il>pay</span>&nbsp;for your stories!
