<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Rob Kardashian Has Filed A Battery Lawsuit Against His Ex-Fiancee Blac Chyna</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Rob Kardashian</strong>, 34, has moved to drop his assault and battery case against ex-fiancée Blac Chyna, 33, without prejudice, and a Los Angeles court has granted his request.&nbsp;Kardashian revealed in a recent statement that his choice was taken exclusively for the benefit of his five-year-old daughter, Dream. According to E! News and Page Six, he stated:</p><p>“My determination to continue with my accusations against Dream’s mother in a public trial greatly surpasses my love for her.” For the benefit of our kid, I am dropping the lawsuit and concentrating on my co-parenting relationship with Chyna now that the court has found that there is sufficient evidence to sustain a jury trial on my claim for assault.”</p><p>However, Chyna’s attorney, Lynne Ciani, argued that Kardashian’s dismissal was motivated by anything other than the health of the former couple’s baby.</p><p>She told the same media outlets on Friday:</p><p>“Rob Kardashian should have considered his daughter Dream before filing his spiteful and unfounded assault and battery case.” For more than four years, Rob has attempted to tarnish Chyna as a mother and even as a human being by using his riches and position via this vexatious litigation.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rob-Kardashian-2.jpg alt="Rob Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ciani also said that Kardashian’s charges of domestic violence were false:</p><p>“Rob abandoned his lawsuit on the eve of trial, not because he felt compelled to do so ‘for the sake of his daughter,’ but because he knew his assault and battery allegations against Chyna were untrue.”</p><p>Ciani discussed the following actions Chyna will take to prevent Kardashian from refiling the case and make him pay for the claimed damages he has caused. She ended by saying:</p><p>“In other words, Rob abandoned his lawsuit to escape the potential implications of a negative jury decision, not out of ‘care’ for his daughter.” Chyna will now seek judicial intervention to prevent Rob from refiling his case and to make him pay for her considerable legal fees.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rob-Kardashian-3.jpg alt="Rob Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>A glance at Rob Kardashian’s lawsuit against Blac Chyna.</h2><p>Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian began dating in January 2016, and their daughter, Dream, was born in November of that year. The couple divorced in the summer of 2017.&nbsp;Kardashian sued Chyna in September 2017, alleging that she beat him and committed domestic abuse at their former residence in December 2016. In a drug and alcohol-fueled frenzy, the KUWtK grad claimed Chyna attempted to strangle him with the cable of an iPhone charger.</p><p>Even though he could flee the assault at first, Chyna punched him in the face and head many times, according to Kardashian. As a result, he supposedly suffered significant neck injuries. Two of Rob Kardashian’s pals, Eugene Shpilsky and Victory Belz, reportedly observed Chyna waving a pistol at him and threatening his life on two separate occasions. They would have been asked to testify on his side if the trial hadn’t been canceled.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rob-Kardashian-4.jpg alt="Rob Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In court records, Kris Jenner’s boyfriend, Corey Gamble, who was meant to be in court for Kardashian, stated:</p><p>“I attempted to separate Chyna and Rob so that I could assist Rob is leaving the home and away from Chyna.” Despite my best efforts to interfere, Chyna continued to abuse Rob. While I assisted Rob is leaving the home, Chyna proceeded to rush at him and hit him many times in the head, face, and back. Rob did not fight back, instead of attempting to hide from Chyna’s physical assault.”</p><p>When Gamble made this claim, Ciani retorted that there had been “no physical assault” on Kardashian. “The evidence demonstrates that Rob and Chyna, a thrilling engaged couple at the time, had a rowdy and flirtatious night together on December 14, 2016, to celebrate,” she added. On that occasion, the two were enjoying the second season of their old reality TV show, according to Ciani.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipqJpdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK1or%2BMn6ClnZRirm6uwK2rnqqpYrmiw9KuoK1lkZyuqrrSrWShoaNisrl5xaKYp5uVmnqjuMCcZJygqaOucA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauri-markkanen.html><span>←</span><span>Lauri Markkanen Bio: Net Worth [2023 Update]</span></a>
