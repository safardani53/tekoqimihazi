At just 22 years old, Tim took up stand-up comedy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks to a dare</a> from his friends. He performed at Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle in Royal Oak, Mich., which gave him the basis to start a career in the field. His successful stand-up landed him a slew of local commercials and cable comedy programs.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tim had a bit of a life hiccup right as he was just getting started. In 1978, the star was arrested for drug trafficking and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sentenced to two years</a> and four months in prison. Following his 1981 release, Tim relocated to Los Angeles to start fresh as a comedian and nabbed a regular gig as a performer at the Comedy Store.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The next few years of doing stand-up and bit parts eventually led him in 1991 to the first role that would define his career going forward: Home Improvement, the hit ABC sitcom that he is now known for starring in. The 1990s were very good to Tim, who snowballed the success from Home Improvement into a variety of other successful gigs such as a starring role in The Santa Clause in 1994 as well as the release of his 1994 New York Times bestseller, Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man.</p><p>By 1995, his next defining role came along: voicing <a href=#>Buzz Lightyear</a> in Toy Story. He would go on to voice the beloved Disney-Pixar character in the sequels.</p><p>Tim took on a variety of other successful movie roles throughout the 2000s and 2010s such as 2001's Joe Somebody and 2004's Christmas With the Kranks, as well as a starring role on the TV series Last Man Standing, which started in 2011 and ended in 2021. He is still active as an actor today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauecClo56mXaOytXnWqKmtoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-destiny-19950108-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Destiny (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
