Following the former couple’s split, the retired MLB star predicted his future includes a sweet love story.</p><p class=p1>“I think I’m gonna make a wonderful partner or husband and father post-suspension, because of the lessons learned [from] my biggest mistakes,”&nbsp;Rodriguez said during a CNN interview, which aired earlier this month, noting <a href=#>he believes he is “husband material.”</a> (He was initially <a href=#>suspended from the league in 2014</a> for violating its anti-doping regulations.)</p><p class=p1>He added: “When I was 15 years old, I think&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>&nbsp;called me a top player in the country, and at that time, I was Alex Rodriguez. And then somewhere along the way at 24, I get a $252 million contract, and probably in Texas I lost my way a little bit and I became A-Rod. … I think pre-suspension, <a href=#>if you asked me what’s winning</a> looked like, I would have said big contracts, home runs, World Series, nice cars, women. Post-suspension, I look at more the team-building, being a great father, being a son, being a friend, high character, loyalty, all those things.”</p><p class=p1>The former Yankees athlete was <a href=#>previously married to <strong>Cynthia Scurtis</strong> between 2002 and 2008</a>, with whom he coparents <a href=#>daughters Natasha, 17, and Ella, 14</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s like they’re&nbsp;one big happy family&nbsp;when they’re together,” a second source <a href=#>previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in December 2021</a>, nothing Rodriguez gets along “well” with Scurtis’ new husband, <a href=#><strong>Angel Nicholas</strong></a>. “[The men’s] relationship has turned into a friendship — they support each other. There’s no bad blood there.”</p><p class=p1>Following the&nbsp;<i>Shark Tank&nbsp;</i>alum’s divorce, he moved on with the likes of <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a>. Rodriguez began dating <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> in 2017, <a href=#>proposing two years later</a>. The twosome eventually <a href=#>called off their years-long engagement</a> in April 2021, shortly before the 53-year-old&nbsp;<i>Marry Me&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>moved on with her ex-fiancé</a> <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>.
