The popular daytime talk show returned on September 6th after a weeks-long hiatus.
The View was live for its season premiere as new panelist Alyssa Farah Griffin officially made her debut after becoming a full-time cohost - alongside Ana Navarro - during the break.
The ladies kicked off the program by discussing how each of them spent their free time, which gave Whoopi a chance to vent."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
