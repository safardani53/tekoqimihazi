Each year, Witherspoon welcomes the hilarious craze with open arms and fans spend quality time crafting their own versions of the wreath.</p><p>On Monday, December 18, Witherspoon took to Instagram to share some of this year’s best fandom crafts — and thank her friend who inspired it all. “Y’all are hysterical keeping #WreathWitherspoon going! 😂Which one is your favorite?!” the Big Little Lies actress, 41, captioned the post. “3 years later and still holding strong, @MindyKaling! 😉.”</p><p>It’s not just around the holiday that the two friends embrace “Wreath Witherspoon.” In 2015, the Office alum, 38, <a href=#>gifted Witherspoon</a> — who was nominated for Best Actress for her role in Wild that year — a pink and purple wreath, which was also adorned with a pic of her on the red carpet alongside gold Oscar statues.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Witherspoon wasted no time sharing a snap of the <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> as she placed directly on her front door. “I mean…C’mon! Best gift ever!” she captioned the Instagram pic at the time. “Thanks @mindykaling for my #WreathWitherspoon #Oscar edition. #YesItsOnMyFrontDoor.”</p><p>Kaling and Witherspoon will star alongside each other in the much-anticipated 2018 film A Wrinkle in Time. The movie is set to hit theaters on March 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarnZWosm7DyK2fnqqjpbywuoyjpqSdo2LBqa3TZq6rnZGptW7DyK2fnqqjpbywuoyiqmarpJ65rXnGqKCnn12owbO7zaBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicolo-contrada-mqgk-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nicolo Contrada (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
