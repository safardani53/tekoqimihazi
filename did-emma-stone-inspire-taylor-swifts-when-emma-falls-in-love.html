<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Did Emma Stone Inspire Taylor Swifts When Emma Falls in Love?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> released “When Emma Falls in Love” earlier this year, fans surmised that the track was about her pal <a href=#><strong>Emma Stone</strong></a> — and the actress continues to refuse to confirm or deny this theory.</p><p>“You have to ask her,” Stone, 35, replied during an appearance on<a href=# rel=noopener> The Graham Norton Show</a>, which aired in the U.K. on Sunday, December 31, when host <strong>Graham Norton</strong> wondered whether the idea held any weight.</p><p>This isn’t the first time the Curse actress, who’s a longtime friend of Swift, 34, had been asked to weigh in on the theory. At the Poor Things movie premiere earlier this month, <a href=#>Stone played coy</a> with the same response to the question posed by Entertainment Weekly. (Swift was later spotted supporting Stone at the event.)</p><p>The track, a bonus “From the Vault” song off of Swift’s Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) album, has <a href=#>had fans wondering</a> since its July release whether it’s about Stone as several lyrics seem to reference the actress.</p><p>In the first verse, Swift sings, “When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom / Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong. She waits and takes her time / ‘Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it’s gonna rain.”</p><p>Listeners speculated that the “little miss sunshine” lyric was a nod to Stone’s iconic Easy A scene where she sang <strong>Natasha Bedingfield</strong>’s “Pocketful of Sunshine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emma-and-Taylor.jpg><p>In the chorus, Swift sings, “To tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her,” which led listeners to point to a 2011 interview where Swift admitted she would want to be Stone “for a day.”</p><p>“She’s one of my really, really good friends and she’s so funny,” Swift gushed at the time, adding, “If I could be that funny for a day that would be amazing, so I would be Emma.”</p><p>Fans also wondered whether the lyrics were in reference to Stone’s ex <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong> or <strong>Kieran Culkin</strong> — or if the song isn’t about romance at all but a tribute to friendship. Whether or not the track is inspired by Stone, it’s clear that she and Swift have maintained a close bond after initially meeting in 2008 at the Young Hollywood Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emma-Stone-Taylor-Swift-in-2008.jpg><p>“We just kept in touch ever since and became great friends,” Stone said on Sunday.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Stone admitted she’s been to three of Swift’s Eras Tour stops “so far,” and recalled watching the concert in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>“What was very special about the first night of her tour was I had no idea what to expect, obviously, because it was night one,” Stone said, adding that Swift worked alongside choreographer <strong>Mandy Moore</strong> for her tour, whom Stone had previously worked with during La La Land. “It was a bunch of lovely things all come together, and it was incredible to see.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadoZRisq65wGaqraeemnqqutKpoKudXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwbR51qGcp2WVorqiecWao6WrXZ67brjOr5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carie-graves.html><span>←</span><span>Carie Graves</span></a>
