But we miss him every day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jennie-Garth-Luke-Perry-Was-With-Us-Every-Second-While-Filming-BH90210-03.jpg><p>Perry <a href=#>died at the age of 52</a> on March 4 after suffering a massive stroke. His rep gave a statement to Us at the time, saying, “[Perry] was surrounded by his children Jack and Sophie, fiancée <strong>Wendy Madison Bauer</strong>, ex-wife <strong>Minnie Sharp</strong>, mother Ann Bennett, stepfather Steve Bennett, brother Tom Perry, sister Amy Coder and other close family and friends. The family appreciates the outpouring of support and prayers that have been extended to Luke from around the world.”</p><p>Though the Oz alum <a href=#>wasn’t set to be a part of the upcoming revival</a>, his death made a big impact on the rest of the group.</p><p>”<a href=#>Luke was a huge part of our 90210 family</a> and personally Luke was a very large part of my life,” Priestley, 49, told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a> in May.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jennie-Garth-Luke-Perry-Was-With-Us-Every-Second-While-Filming-BH90210-02.jpg><p>Added Ziering, 55, “Yeah, you know, I’m still having trouble reconciling that. … It’s difficult.
