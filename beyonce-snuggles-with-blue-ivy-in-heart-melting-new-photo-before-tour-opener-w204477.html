She also recalled driving to the arena with Blue.</p><p>“I was driving here tonight, and my daughter said, ‘Mommy, are we going to your work?’ And then we were pulling up to this huge stadium,” she told the crowd. “I remember when I was a little girl that this was my dream …&nbsp;this is a stadium tour that is sold out. You’re helping all of my dreams come true. I want to thank my Beyhive …&nbsp;Remember, nobody is responsible for your happiness but you.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Before the night was over, Queen Bey gave a shout-out to her loved ones before she <a href=#>sang her 2009 hit “Halo.”</a></p><p>“I want to dedicate this one to my beautiful husband.
