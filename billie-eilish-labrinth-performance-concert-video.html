Labrinth rocked a sheer black shirt and pants with a black-and-white photo of a face printed on them.

He’s also gearing up to release his third solo album&nbsp;Ends And Beginnings&nbsp;in August 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Billie has two more hometown shows on her&nbsp;Happier Than Ever&nbsp;tour, and she’ll pick back up with some international dates next year, but it’s nice to see that she’ll have some time to relax and spend time with family for the holidays after the shows.
