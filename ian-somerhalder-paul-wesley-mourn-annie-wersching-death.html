For Annie’s Boys… Freddie, Ozzie and Archie,” she also said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-29-at-3.10.49-PM.png><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Annie was diagnosed with cancer Summer of 2020. She’s a private person by nature, and the diagnosis made her even more so. She wanted to protect her boys,” the message on the GoFundMe page read, aimed at raising money for her husband and sons. “She wanted to get better so she could continue working. And honestly, she just didn’t really want to talk about it. She wanted to live her life, on her terms, and be with her family,” the note also said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Annie lived for her family. She loved her work and cherished her friends, but Steve and the boys were her absolute everything. This Go Fund Me is for them. It’s so Steve can have time to grieve without the pressure of needing to work. So he can be daddy to Freddie (12), Ozzie (9) and Archie (4) as they navigate the future without their mom, without sweet Annie,” the message continued.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“It’s so they can continue to go to baseball games (Go Cardinals!) take music lessons and play little league. It’s to help pay for college. It’s so Steve can continue Annie’s tradition of filling the house with every life-sized balloon that’ll fit in the car for birthday mornings. It’s to give them time to navigate life as a family of four without the burden of paying medical bills or funeral expenses. It’s so they can continue to live life in a way that they know would make Annie proud,” it also read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5FyZqKZnmLAsLnEq5%2BapJSav268wK6jZq%2BVqLmmxYympq6qnmKur7rInmSwnaKosKm1zaBknZ2RqbVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-paris-unfollows-glen-powell-sparks-split-speculation.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Paris Unfollows Glen Powell, Sparks Split Speculation</span></a>
