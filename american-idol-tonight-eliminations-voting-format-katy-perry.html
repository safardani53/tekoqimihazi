Instead of giving people time to watch & digest the performances, they go 3 hours until 11PM EST when voting opens, and end voting at 9 AM the next day.</p><p>"What's the rush? How does that make for a fair competition?"</p><p>A fourth said: "We could have cut this American Idol episode from 3 hours to 1 hour. If we didn’t have to focus so much on backstory. Just show me their talent and let me vote."</p><p>A fifth wrote: "It's only 9:15. I want to get my American Idol votes in<br>but we have to wait until 11:00."</p><p>Indeed, fans had to wait until the end of the long episode to even vote for their favorites with barely anyone eliminated along the way.</p><h2><strong>Here's who made it to the top 20:</strong></h2><ul><li>Hannah Nicolaisen, 23 from <a href=#>Texas</a></li><li>Haven Madison, 16 from <a href=#>Tennessee</a></li><li>Iam Tongi, 18 from <a href=#>Hawaii</a></li><li>Kaeyra, 21 from <a href=#>Illinois</a></li><li>Lucy Love, 28 from <a href=#>Arkansas</a></li><li>Mariah Faith, 21 from <a href=#>South Carolina</a></li><li>Matt Wilson, 21 from <a href=#>New York</a></li><li>Nailyah Serenity, 22 from <a href=#>North Carolina</a></li><li>Oliver Steele, 25 from Tennessee</li><li>Olivia Soli, 20 from <a href=#>California</a></li><li>Warren Peay, 24 from South Carolina</li><li>Zachariah Smith, 19 from&nbsp;<a href=#>Mississippi</a></li><li>Nutsa, 25 from the Republic of Georgia</li><li>Oliver Steele, 25 from Tennessee</li><li>Olivia Soli, 20 from California</li><li>Paige Anne, 16 from Idaho</li><li>Tyson Venegas (Platinum ticket winner), 17 from Canada</li><li>Warren Peay, 24 from South Carolina</li><li>Wé Ani, 23 from New York</li><li>Zachariah Smith, 19 from&nbsp;Mississippi</li></ul><h2>Here's who went home:</h2><ul><li>Elise Kristine, 18 from <a href=#>Washington</a></li><li>Emma Busse, 20 from <a href=#>Canada</a></li><li>PJAE, 23 from <a href=#>Oklahoma</a></li><li>Dawson Wayne, 21 from Texas</li><li>Elijah McCormick (Platinum ticket winner), 21 from North Carolina</li><li>Malik Heard, 26 from Texas</li></ul><h2><strong>PERRY CONCERNING</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, Idol producers are reportedly "rattled" by judge Katy's behavior this season.</p><p>Fans have slammed&nbsp;the judge&nbsp;throughout the season, and a source called her comments to contestants "rude and condescending."</p><p>Sources revealed exclusively to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar</a>&nbsp;that producers are taking note of the judge's behavior, with an insider saying: "Producers are so rattled by Katy's behavior they're considering replacing her to keep the audience happy."</p><p>Notable contestant Sara Beth Lieb quit the show during Hollywood Week after fans called Katy out for&nbsp;<a href=#>"mom-shaming" her</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video posted after her viral audition, Sarah addressed the incident where Katy told the mom-of-three: "you've been laying on the table too much."</p><p>She said: "I mean it was embarrassing to have that on TV and it was hurtful and you know, that's that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/american-idol-fans-slam-new-812194535.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/american-idol-fans-slam-new-812194529.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/american-idol-fans-slam-new-812194517.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaWmDdoSVaJimnaKesKK6jKKbqKRdqbyvtcahq2adnJ66qrrAraCopqNiw7DAyKeeZp6fp7qiwIykmK2xXaWys77YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-dabate-now.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is Rick Dabate Now?
