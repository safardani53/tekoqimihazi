Anyone who she thinks is taking advantage of her daughter financially is immediately “no good.” Unfortunately, Carmon has found herself on Joyce’s bad side — and has been forced to confront the senior citizen’s claim that she slept with Kandi’s husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Kandi’s aunts don’t believe Mama Joyce’s story about Carmon’s supposed tryst with Todd, they do have a theory about her cruel demeanor. “She’s on a lot of medication right now,” Aunt Bertha sighs. “Don’t nobody know what that medicine is doing.” Maybe what the medication is “doing” is causing Kandi’s mom to lash out at Carmon. On last week’s episode, Mama Joyce cursed her out, saying, “F–k you, you little a–hole!” Yikes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Mama Joyce takes medication after undergoing brain surgery to prevent a stroke or an aneurism. “After the surgery Joyce had, one day Joyce is okay. The next day it’s a new Joyce because of the surgery,” Bertha explains. Here’s to hoping there are more “okay” days to come!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Instead holding a grudge against the 65-year-old, Carmon is showing her sympathy. “I just kind of feel sorry for Mama Joyce,” she explains. “The situation is beyond me. It’s beyond the rumor. It’s some real issues that Mama Joyce needs to solve.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Aunt Nora agrees. “I’m so worried about my sister!” she cries. “I don’t know. What can I do to help my sister? I don’t know! I just, I just don’t know.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Real Housewives Of Atlanta: Kandi’s Ski Trip&nbsp;finale airs June 7 at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — let us know what YOU think about Kandi’s mom, Mama Joyce!
