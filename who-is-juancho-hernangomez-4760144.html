Juancho revealed in an interview that he turned down calls to audition for the role several times before he changed his mind.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I never dreamed about it. So I told them no for five or six months, and then Covid hits. I wasn’t on a team. I was doing quarantine with my brother and my sister, and we were so bored that my sister knew about the casting, and she was like, ‘Why don’t we play like [we’re] doing a movie?’ and we just did the audition. I don’t know why or how they saw any talent, but they just liked me, and we just kept going to castings, and we made a movie,” Juancho told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Slash Film</a>. Adam calls Juancho a “natural” at acting.</p><h2>2. Juancho plays for the Utah Jazz.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Juancho is currently a forward for the Utah Jazz. After playing in Spain, Juancho entered the NBA Draft in 2016. The Denver Nuggets selected the basketball player in the 15th overall pick.</p><h2>3.

Juancho recently said he wasn’t ‘happy’ playing for the Celtics.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Juancho was traded to the Boston Celtics in September 2021. He was on the Celtics roster until January 2022. “I wasn’t happy there, it was very hard,” Juancho told El País’<strong> Daniel Arribas</strong> in Spanish, as translated by <a href=# data-timestamp=1654460102 rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yahoo Sports</a>. “There was no communication, I didn’t know what was expected of me. There were many super selfish players, no team building. I lost my love for basketball a bit.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3tq3NnJ%2BoZZiav6%2BtzaCmpp2qYoF4go9qa21n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alaskan-bush-people-star-train-brown-reveals-depression-battle.html><span>←</span><span>Suffering From Depression Amid Ami Brown Cancer Battle</span></a>
