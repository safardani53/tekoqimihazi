Before the release, the synopsis and trailer were investigated.</h2><p>Devil in Ohio is a thriller that recounts the narrative of Mae, a young girl who seeks safety in the house of psychiatrist Dr. Suzanne Mathis. However, Mae‚Äôs arrival in the home quickly turns the family‚Äôs lives upside down as she attempts to steal Jules, Suzanne‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs life.&nbsp;Jules then discovers that Mae is a survivor of a bizarre cult in a neighboring town, and they would go to any length to reclaim Mae.

The teaser also reveals the perils that Suzanne may face once the investigations begin. Furthermore, Mae seems to be developing an infatuation with Suzanne and Jules, Suzanne‚Äôs kid.</p><h2>When will the series be released?</h2><p>Devil in Ohio, a Netflix original, will be released on Friday, September 2, 2022. Because it is a Netflix series, all of the episodes will be released on the same day.
