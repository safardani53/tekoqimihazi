Luckily I don’t have that and it’s a lovely, happy thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/40d3f5b3-14bd-4cbc-b6e5-e26d666b1fa6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cherry-healey-carl-kisseih-attend-828462342.jpg><p>Cherry&nbsp;is from an aristocratic background - her dad Nicholas is the son of a 4th Baronet and she attended posh Cheltenham Ladies College before completing a degree in drama.</p><p>She is known for her documentaries on BBC Three including a trio of films about her own life, including Cherry Has a Baby, Cherry Gets Married and Cherry’s Body Dilemmas.</p><p>Cherry has also <a href=#>presented shows like Inside The Factory</a> with <a href=#>Gregg Wallace</a>, <a href=#>who quit the programme in March this year</a>, and The Jump’s spin-off show On The Piste and has appeared on Celebrity MasterChef.</p><p>Despite her upper-class upbringing Cherry is refreshingly down-to-earth and talks to us from her kitchen with her hair in a messy bun wearing virtually no make-up.</p><p>“I was rushing from one place to another today and at one point my mascara was smudged in the back of a taxi as I went to my next meeting, but I don’t worry about those things nowadays.”</p><p>Cherry says age has taught her more about her personal style too.</p><p>She says: “In my early 30s I had no idea if my style was boho, mix and mix, just crazy, but now I know who I am in every single way. I like to wear really clean lines and casual clothes.</p><p>“If I’m going out on a date, now that the kids are older, I have a little bit more headspace to get ready. I’ll put on some music, spend some time doing my make-up and, because I know what clothes suit me, I find it quite easy to get dressed.”</p><h2>4am nightmares</h2><p>Cherry hit the <a href=#>perimenopause </a>two years ago but said at one time she blamed her symptoms on splitting from Carl.</p><p>She explained: “I’m generally a really good sleeper and don’t suffer from anxiety but I was waking up at 4am and sitting up bolt right and feeling anxious, unable to get back to sleep.</p><p>“It was the closest to a panic attack I’ve ever felt. I’ve never experienced anything like it.</p><p>“I was making a programme for Channel Five about health taboos at the time and, even though I was talking to people about the perimenopause I was thinking ‘Don’t be silly, it can’t be that’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cherry-healey-taken-instagram-751529564-1.jpg><p>“I knew my relationship was coming to an end which was really distressing and thought ‘maybe I’m stressed about that’. But then the relationship ended and everything stayed the same and I thought ‘this must be hormonal’.</p><p>“I got advice from some of the doctors on the show who said to get supplements, keep perfect sleep hygiene, watch my alcohol intake like a hawk and get some exercise.</p><p>“So far I’m managing but if I need <a href=#>HRT</a> I will go to my GP without shame or question.”</p><p>Cherry last week <a href=#>joined a female protest in London </a>against tech bosses who banned Bodyform adverts on Facebook that used words such as ‘vagina’ and ‘menstrual cycle.’</p><p>Meta says the campaign ads were moved by mistake and have since been reinstated but Cherry says the ban was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Research by Bodyform reveals that words to describe women’s autonomy are routinely banned on sites like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok.</p><p>Vagina is the most flagged word on <a href=#>Facebook</a> and countless women have complained that their tasteful breastfeeding pictures have been removed.</p><p>The Jump presenter raged: “I’m sorry, but in ten years time we are being told we’ll all be hiding from <a href=#>AI</a> robots so, if we’re looking at that kind of sophistication in tech, then surely it can tell the difference between a female in a sexual situation and a woman breastfeeding?</p><p>“With the technology we have and the algorithms, surely we can stop words such as endometriosis, vagina and vulva and period being censored?</p><p>“This is where misogyny comes in because it takes time to sort the coding and algorithms to sort this out and most of the big tech companies are owned by men.”</p><p>Cherry, who is famous for her female-focussed BBC Three documentaries, also said stars like&nbsp;<a href=#> Beyonce</a> and<a href=#> Kim Kardashian</a> must join in the female movement to talk openly about women’s issues - including the menopause.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She said: “If there’s ever a taboo for someone who has made their money out of being glamorous and relevant, it’s getting older.</p><p>“It would be so powerful and important if women in the public eye who are visible, like Kim Kardashian, say ‘yes my body has changed, but I’m still vibrant and I’m wise and I’m still working’.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Frb29vaWqAcK%2FHnqmrsV2dsqK4xLJkoqajnrGmedOhnGaekZjBsL7YZqOorpViuaqyxGaZqLGWp7amusNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sanjiv-yajnik.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Sanjiv Yajnik net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
