In the snaps, fans can <a href=#>spot a tattoo on the back of her leg</a> below her derrière. The ink reads, “January 21st, 1994.”</p><p class=p1>While the <i>Nope </i>star has not further explained her tattoo inspiration, the numbers correspond to her boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Darius Jackson</strong></a>’s date of birth. Instead, Palmer used her Instagram caption to honor her “Durrty Thirty” celebration.</p><p class=p1>“Being grateful is the KEY, so showing gratitude is always the move,” she <a href=#>penned on Saturday.</a> “I am blessed and grateful to see another year. I am grateful my family and I are healthy. I’m bringing in ‘30’ by being me and being better <span class=s1>😊</span>.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “To all my fellow Virgos keep being bold, gentle and true. Here’s to finding more balance in self-expression from personal and professional life. God Bless <span class=s1>🙏🏾</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Jackson, 29, has been dating Palmer since 2021 and they share son Leodis, <a href=#>who was born in February</a>. The personal trainer <a href=#>marked the birthday girl’s special day</a> by treating her to lunch on Saturday.</p><p class=p1>“D, <a href=#>thank you for taking me out to lunch</a> on my birthday as always,” Palmer said in an Instagram Live video on Jackson’s account. “I know, it’s not always my birthday but you always do take me out. I just thank you for making it special and it’s so sweet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keke-palmer-actually-has-a-tattoo-of-partner-darius-jacksons-birth-date-on-her-butt-inline.jpg><p class=p1>Jackson — who gushed that Palmer was his “partner-in-crime” — also tweeted his birthday wishes for the <i>Scream Queens</i> alum.</p><p class=p1>“Happy Birthday to a one-of-a-kind being. Hoping your 30s brings you many joys & triumphs,” he wrote via X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday, sharing a home video of Palmer cuddling <a href=#>their 6-month-old baby boy</a>.</p><p class=p1>Palmer and Jackson’s relationship has been rocky since July when <a href=#>he publicly shamed her for wearing a sheer bodysuit</a> to <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>’s concert.</p><p class=p1>“It’s the outfit tho … you a mom,” Jackson tweeted at the time. “We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn’t want the wife & mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others & he gets told how much of a hater he is. This is my family & my representation. I have standards & morals to what I believe. I rest my case.”</p><p class=p1>Palmer h<a href=#>as not publicly addressed Jackson’s comments</a>, but a source told <i>Us Weekly </i>that their relationship status is “complicated.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It’s their own lives. Those close to them hope they can work things out for the sake of themselves and their child,” <a href=#>the insider exclusively told <i>Us</i></a> earlier this month. “They have to resolve things on their own.”</p><p class=p1>According to the source, Palmer and Jackson “love each other” but “keep their life very private.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6CyrLGMqZilpZWneqWxwa6rrGWUlr%2BqwdJmoZqbm6i8r3nTq6CbraSaerWt062mqGWRm8GmvoydqZqlkWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keith-levene-the-co-founder-of-the-clash-and-public-image-ltd-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>Keith Levene The Co-Founder Of The Clash And Public Image Ltd Passed Away</span></a>
