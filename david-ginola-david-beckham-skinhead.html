I could never shave my head a la David Beckham.</p><p>"My first thought when he got a Brylcreem deal was that he must have swapped his contract for Brylcreem with Gillette.”</p><p>Ginola said his time as a model has led to him receiving no shortage of stick from fans.</p><p>“Sometimes I will be at an airport and a member of the public will come up to me and say: 'Look, it’s the guy from the shampoo advert' rather than: 'Look, it’s that footballer.'"</p><p>The 54-year-old has also revealed that he one day fancies a stint as a football manager - and already has a haircut in mind should he land a job.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>“I would be tough as a manager,” he said in memoir La Magnifique.</p><p>“The first thing I would do is shave my head to make me look meaner and make people accept me.</p><p>Today, we told how David could remain on our screens long after the ITV show ends - he wants to star in movies.&nbsp;</p><p>And the footy pin up says he’s already had offers and thinks Brad Pitt and Kevin Costner are the stars most suited to his acting style...</p><p>He said: “I think I could make it as an actor because I always put myself in the position of someone else and that is what acting is all about, seeing a role through different eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>“As it happens, I have already been approached to act in films.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>🔵</strong> <strong>Read our <a href=#>I'm A Celeb 2021 live blog</a>for the latest updates</strong></p><p>Explaining the kind of role he’d want Ginola added: “I would never play the role of someone whose character is the opposite of mine.</p><p>"I would have to be close to the role to get into it. I quite fancy myself in films like Dances With Wolves with Kevin Cosnter, or Legends of the Fall with Brad Pitt.</p><p>"If I wanted to be an actor it would be possible for me to have a go.”</p><p>David set out his ambition in his memoir La Magnifique.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000442107424-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000693915805-2.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>I'm A Celebrity 2021 star David Ginola talks survival tips and biggest fears before entering Gwrych Castle</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun Showbiz team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSBcoGUbWdvZ5SWw6qwjKCgp6eclnqlrdWim2aalZi4qa3MZqqkoZ6dsqKwjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./blue-moon-odom.html><span>Fame | Blue Moon Odom net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
