After doing our reserach, we discovered that fans swear these pads really do take make-up off with water and a swipe. We decided to see if they live up to their reputation.</p><p>First of all, we have to mention how soft these pads are, they feel really gentle against your face. After rinsing one of the pads with warm water, we swiped it over our full face of makeup and were shocked at how quickly it was removed without having to actually scrub, even mascara!</p><p>As they're white, the dirt obviously shows up quite a lot so after you've used both sides, they're hard to clean with only soap and water. You need to actually put them in the washing machine to have them good as new for another use.</p><p>They definitely did the job though, removing all of our make-up, yet it doesn't feel like enough to entirely cleanse your face so we proceeded to use face wash afterwards.</p><p>You can wash them up to 200 times, so we're definitely here for Face Halo as a sustainable and effective make-up remover option.</p><h2>We tested: GLOV Moon Pads</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-279.jpg><ul><li><strong>GLOV Moon Pads, <span class="jsx-3240896549 nowPrice" data-test=price>£8.90 for 5 from Look Fantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>GLOV is another brand to know for sustainable, reusable cleansing cloths, pads and mitts.</p><p>Made from microfibres, Moon Pads - which come in eco starch packaging that only takes a year to decompose - replace nearly 500 single-use cotton wool pads each, and are ideal for make-up removal.</p><p>Being bright pink and fluffy, they're definitely the prettiest pads around, so we decided to see if they do the job well, too.</p><p>First impressions? GLOV Moon Pads are ridiculously soft and fluffy, so much so that they don't really look like cosmetic pads that you want to dirty in mascara and foundation.</p><p>However, once rinsed in water, they remove your make-up really easily, while feeling gentle on your face. Once you've finished wiping away your make-up, all it takes is some warm water and a touch of soap to quickly clean the pads.</p><p>Our only criticism is that they don't look particularly sturdy as you can see the seam around the edges, but honestly, these are our favourite reusable pads that we have tried out so far.</p><h2>Best reusable bamboo cotton pads: Waxzaa Reusable Makeup Remover Pads (23 pack)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Amazon-bamboo-pads.jpg><p>This 23-piece set of reusable cotton pads includes a mesh laundry bag and simply requires you to add cleanser or water to the pad to remove any dirt or make-up.</p><p>Suitable for all skin types, they're made of 70 percent bamboo, which is sourced responsibly and sustainbly, and 30 percent organic cotton - meaning they're super soft, even on the most sensitive skin.</p><p>Each pad is chemical-free, and made from two layers of bamboo, which the brand estimates can be used 1,000 times.</p><p>The mesh laundry bag means you can transport them easily, maybe even to the gym and back, then chuck them in the laundry (on a 30 degree wash) once used if they need an extra bit of TLC.</p><h2>Best reusable microfibre cotton pads: Smuka microfibre makeup remover pads</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-09.29.30.png><ul><li><strong>Smuka <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Reusable Makeup Remover Pads Organic, £10.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>Made from high-quality microfibre, these organic cotton cloth pads have three layers to thoroughly remove make-up and apply toner to the skin.</p><p>The microfibre qualities of the pad means that one swipe penetrates deep into pores, removing even the most stubborn of make-up.</p><p>Since they're chemical-free, they're a fantastic choice for those with sensitive or allergy-prone skin. These machine washable wipes (chuck them in at 40 degrees) come in a selection of colours to pep up your morning routine, too.</p><h2>Best biodegradable cotton pads: Jinmee Hydrapuff skincare sheets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-09.45.30.png><ul><li><strong>Jinmee Hydrapuff Skincare Sheets (60 pack), £6.50 from Jimnee - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you're looking for a cotton pad that's ideal for applying any liquid skincare products, this is your solution.</p><p>Korean brand Jinmee has created these 'innovative sponge-like sheets' which help products absorb more easily into your skin and essentially turn into sheet masks once you apply them - without destroying the planet.</p><p>It soaks up any liquid skincare, like toner, cleanser and more, then fully releases them deep into your skin without wasting any products.</p><p>Ideal for travelling, these are made from natural rayon pulp so they're biodegradable. They're also vegan and cruelty-free.</p><h2>Best reusable cotton cleansing cloth: Magnitone WipeOut! microfibre cleansing cloth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-09.59.50.png><ul><li><strong>Magnitone London WipeOut!

Just simply wash with soap and hang to dry (you can also pop them in the washing machine, once a week).</p><h2>How do you wash reusable cotton pads?</h2><p>To prevent them from fraying, wash your reusable cotton pads in a delicates bag (in fact, some reusable cotton pads come with a handy - often mesh - laundry bag).</p><p>They need to be washed frequently - usually every time you've used them to remove make-up that's thick or stubborn - to get rid of any dirt and bacteria.</p><p>Also, pay attention to the detergent you're washing them with: don't use any thing too strong as you don't want to irritate your skin.</p><p>It's often recommended to wash on a 30 or 40 degree Celsius wash, but it is worth checking with the supplied instructions, first, as some can be washed by hand with some warm water.</p><h2>Are reusable cotton pads hygienic?</h2><p>Absolutely - reusable cotton pads are hygienic.</p><p>However, they do require regular washing - every time you take off your mascara, foundation or cleanser, you'll need to wash the pad you used to ensure all dirt and bacteria gets cleaned away.</p><h2>What can I use instead of cotton pads?</h2><p>There are quite a few alternatives to cotton pads now available, like reusable bamboo and microfibre pads.</p><p>Flannels and muslins are good alternatives for face cleansing - after all, a muslin is the basis for the Liz Earle Cleanse & Polish method.</p><p>Konjac sponges - made from the root of a porous Asian vegetable - are becoming increasingly popular as facial cleansing tools that exfoliate and remove make-up.</p><h2>How to make reusable cotton pads</h2><p>If you're handy with a sewing machine, or needle and thread, it can be cheap and easy to make your own reusable cotton pads - if a little time-consuming.</p><p>Source some 100 percent cotton flannel fabric (we've found some <a href=#>here</a> for you) as well as your preferred choice of colours, or patterned, decorative cotton fabric for the backside of the pad.</p><p>Cut small squares, we recommend 3in x 3in of both fabrics, then pin together. Sew around the edge with a straight stitch, by hand or machine, but leave a one inch gap on one side.</p><p>Turn it inside out, then fold in the fabric from the gap you left - iron, and straight stitch around the edges once more. Voila! They'd make a great gift for the eco-conscious friends in your life, and are pretty simple to make a bunch of.</p><h2>Can you use reusable cotton pads for nail polish?</h2><p>Yes, you can use reusable cotton pads for nail polish but you will need to soak one of the pads in nail varnish remover, first.</p><p>We recommend setting aside one pad especially for removing nail polish as the pad will likely discolour, and perhaps stiffen before and after washing.</p><p>Still, it is a much better alternative then using single-use pads when it comes to removing that stubborn nail polish.</p><p>Enjoyed our round-up of the best reusable cotton pads?
