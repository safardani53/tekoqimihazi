After a short period, they decided to legalize their bond, and on March 3, 2018, they shared their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wedding vows</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On March 6, 2018, the former news reporter for USA Today took to her Twitter handle to share&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a picture</a>&nbsp;from her wedding three days after their marriage. In the caption, she wrote that she is taking some time off to celebrate her wedding with her now-husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Since then, the journalist duo has been relishing the time they spend with each other. Their bond can be witnessed through the couple's official Twitter account, where they, once in a while, mention their respective other-half.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>For instance, on November 16, 2018, when Essence magazine shared&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a tweet</a>&nbsp;urging their followers to raise their hands if they love a good groom cry, the former sports reporter for Cleveland.com&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">retweeted</a>&nbsp;it by writing, "no tears for me." Also, in the same tweet, he jokingly said that he hoped his wife would catch his velvet shoes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, the recipient of IWMF's Gwen Ifill Award&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">retweeted</a>&nbsp;her husband's tweet, praising his humor, and mentioned that this is the man she married. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>She Loves to Talk to Her Husband</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As one of the lead correspondents who report directly from the White House, the pressure on Alcindor is immense. One has to be prepared and strong to ask tough questions to the President.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In her case, she has found a partner who understands her responsibility and her work stress. While talking about the same topic&nbsp;on Late Night with Seth Meyers&nbsp;on April 10, 2020, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;how she decompresses after having a hectic day at work. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the exclusive conversation, 2013’s Emerging Journalist of the Year revealed she unwinds with her husband and is lucky to have him by her side. Also, she mentioned she talks about her day with her husband and listens to Bill Withers on repeat.</p><p>Going by her statement, it looks like she loves to spend time with her husband, and their bond is growing stronger with each passing day.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnqZa6qq%2FHnmSapJOeu6W70WafrquSlruledaem52hnpx6rbvWZqerp5aeuaZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-yasmin-deliz-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Yasmin Deliz Dating Now</span></a>
