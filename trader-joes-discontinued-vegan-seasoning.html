The grocery giant told The U.S. Sun that its Vegan Chicken-less Seasoning is gone for good.
The seasoning salt contained onion powder, garlic powder, turmeric, and salt and was free from gluten and MSG.
Although the seasoning itself was vegan, many customers added the product to vegan and non-vegan foods alike, including miso soup, noodles, salads, mashed potatoes, grilled chicken, quinoa, black beans, tofu, mixed greens, fajitas, and veggie burgers."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
