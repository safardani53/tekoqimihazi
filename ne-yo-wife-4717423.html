Other than sharing the news that they were getting married, the pair also shared that they were expecting their first child. The couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first got married</a> in February 2016. “We can’t wait to start our life together,” Ne-Yo told&nbsp;People&nbsp;at the time. “We’re looking forward to just being each others’ best friend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>A month after they first got married, Crystal gave birth to the pair’s first son <strong>Shaffer Chimere Smith Jr.&nbsp;</strong>in March 2016. The couple had another son two years later,&nbsp;<strong>Roman Alexander-Raj Smith,&nbsp;</strong>in June 2018. Unfortunately, the pair announced that they’d be divorcing amicably in February 2020. “There’s nothing bad to say about her; she’s a fantastic woman. She’s the mother of my children. She’s always gonna be that, and I will always respect her,” he said on an episode of the&nbsp;Private Talk With Alexis Texas&nbsp;podcast, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Even though they were planning to split in early 2020, the couple revealed that the quarantine period from the COVID-19 pandemic helped them <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reconcile their marriage.</a> “I did not want to get divorced. I was really, really broken up about it,” he said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 2020 interview</a> with Tamron Hall. “It didn’t feel right. It didn’t make any sense to me.” Now, long after they’ve reconciled, the pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had their third child</a>, a baby girl named <strong>Isabella Rose</strong>, in June 2021.</p><h2><strong>Monyetta Shaw</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ne-yo-wife-Crystal-Renay-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Before he and Crystal got together, Ne-Yo had a long lasting relationship with&nbsp;<strong>Monyetta Shaw.&nbsp;</strong>The pair had their first child,&nbsp;<strong>Madilyn Grace,&nbsp;</strong>in November 2010, per&nbsp;People. “I’ve been in love before but this feels like nothing I’ve ever felt,” the singer said at the time. “Like I’m <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in love for the first time</a>.” Shortly after Madilyn was born, the pair had a son&nbsp;<strong>Mason Evan,&nbsp;</strong>in October 2011, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTV</a>. The pair eventually split in 2013.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Even though they may not be a couple anymore, Monyetta and Ne-Yo still have a strong co-parenting relationship, as she revealed in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>exclusive interview</a> with <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>in October 2018. “Even in the thick of things in the breakup, I was not going to keep them away or do it separate because I was mad,” she said. “I sucked it up and just did it.&nbsp;I cant imagine taking that away from them because of whatever I’m going through that day or his feelings. It’s not acceptable.”</p><h2><strong>Jessica White</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ne-yo-wife-Crystal-Renay-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before he met Monyetta, Ne-Yo had a long-standing relationship with singer and model <strong>Jessica White. </strong>When Jessica gave birth to her first son in 2005, she named him <strong>Chimere, </strong>and for a long time, he raised the child as his own. Unfortunately, a paternity test revealed that the baby wasn’t Ne-Yo’s and the pair split shortly after, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82eZLKnXay2p7GMbW5qb2RngHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./regal-rexnord.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Regal Rexnord net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
