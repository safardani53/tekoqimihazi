Let take a quick look at what the&nbsp;almost billionaire's car collection has going for it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>He Owns a Porsche Previously&nbsp;Owned by&nbsp;Ferry Porsche</h2><p>Central to Seinfeld's collection is a 1964 Porsche 911, which he acquired in 1996. It is an iconic collector's item by its make and model alone, but that is not what makes it special.&nbsp;</p><p>The car was once owned by the late&nbsp;Ferry Porsche, the son of the legendary&nbsp;Ferdinand Porsche&nbsp;Sr.—founder of Volkswagen and Porsche. The comedian purchased the car for four hundred thousand dollars and spend another two hundred fifty grand over the next five years to restore this beauty.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He also spent a bulk of that time working on the car by himself. After he did what he could, he sent the car to Porsche in Germany to&nbsp;get the most specialized repairs possible. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>It Is Illegal to Drive His 1983 Porsche 959 in the US</h2><p>Porsches make up for a good chunk of the veteran comic's collection, and not all Porsches are created equal. Take this slick 1983 Porsche 959, for example. There were only 200 of these cars ever made.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>The 1983 Porsche 959</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 959 was so rare that the German manufacturer could not send the US Department of Transport enough units for testing. Hence, it does not have a safety and emissions perming, making it illegal to drive in the states.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The ownership of the sportscar is preserved under "Show and Display" laws that prohibit any road time. According to Motor Biscuit, even Bill Gates tried to smuggle this car into the country, but he was caught, and the vehicle was impounded.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Seinfeld Owns Over 150 Vehicles</h2><p>Including the rare and iconic wheels mentioned above, the automobile enthusiast had a hundred and fifty vehicles parked in his 1.4 million dollar garage. As you might expect, his luxury car collection boasts of a lot more than just Porsches. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His massive car collection was estimated to be worth anywhere from fifty to a hundred and fifty million dollars. One might be surprised to hear of the hundred million dollar range, but you have to understand that the values of these machines are ever-changing and subjective.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He Sold Eighteen Cars in 2016</h2><p>There are times when even the billionaires have to sell off a few old cars to make room for more old cars. So in 2016, Seinfeld <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sold</a> eighteen of his prized cars for a whopping twenty-two million dollars.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Gooding and Company held the auction, and despite the massive sales figures, the auction made headlines for going south. The auction hauled in a grand total of 22.2 million dollars against a projected estimate of 28 million to 32 million dollars.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Out of the eighteen cars sold&nbsp;on the auction held at&nbsp;Amelia Island, Florida, sixteen were Porsches.&nbsp;</p><h2>His 2000 Porsche Carrera GT Didn't Sell at the Auction</h2><p>2000 Porsche Carrera GT is a very <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">memorable</a> car for a lot of people, albeit for all the wrong reasons. It was the last car that The Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker drove.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The one that Seinfeld&nbsp;owns is actually a prototype, and he put it up on the 2016 auction. Surprisingly, the car could not be sold during the event.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX2p6p63Crapmq5Weu6exy51knJmiYrCwuMuemq2hn6N7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-julian-perez-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Julian Perez Dating Now</span></a>
