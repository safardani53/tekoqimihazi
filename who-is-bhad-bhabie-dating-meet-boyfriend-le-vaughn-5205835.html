While the rapper has cleared up her Instagram, only one photo of them together has remained. She did reportedly post a now-deleted video with Le Vaughn back in 2021, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AmoMama</a>.&nbsp;“Love this man 100x over,” she wrote in one of her deleted posts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Prior to announcing her pregnancy, Bhad Bhabie did share a cute <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of the two of them sitting courtside at an NBA game. Le Vaughn’s hand was resting on her leg. In the caption, she wrote, “Happy Birthday baby” with a light blue heart emoji.</p><h2>Bhad Bhabie Has a Tattoo for Her Beau</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bhad Bhabie is no stranger to tattoos, and she even appeared to have one that made reference to her beau. She revealed that she got a tattoo that had the time “11:11” written out in April 2023, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. While that is certainly a lucky time for many people, it’s also the same as Le Vaughn’s birthday: November 11 (11/11).</p><h2>Bhad Bhabie Has Made Appearances on Le Vaughn’s Social Media</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While the pair appear to mostly keep their romance private, Le Vaughn has posted a handful of photos of himself with his girlfriend over the year. He also posted a courtside <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> on his birthday, as well as Danielle <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adjusting her shoes</a> when he showed off some of his collection. In another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a>, the pair appeared to be backstage at a concert.</p><h2>Le Vaughn Is Already a Father</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Danielle’s baby isn’t going to be Le Vaughn’s first child. He’s already a father to one baby boy. He posted a few cute photos of his son back in July 2023, and he wished his son a happy birthday on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>Bhad Bhabie’s Past Relationships</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Danielle has mostly kept her relationships private, she did appear to reveal that she was briefly dating fellow rapper&nbsp;<strong>Yung Bans&nbsp;</strong>when she posted a photo of the two of them in bed together. As she was under 18 at the time, fans were concerned, because Yung Bans was 20. She defended him in an Instagram comment, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>VladTV</a>.&nbsp;“He’s 20 i’m 17…ain’t nothing wrong with 3 years so relax,” she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kvqa3DZpmhmZKesm6wwK2gp59dorKmwIybprKeop6yr7CMpZxmrpGqtKm6jG5paW1oaIJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-avrey-ovard-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Avrey Ovard Dating Now</span></a>
