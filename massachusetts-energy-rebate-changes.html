the environmental impacts of their energy use, according to the director of customer energy management at National Grid.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on rebates">Read more on rebates</h2><p>Chris Porter with National Grid said it aids Massachusetts homeowners in switching from fossil-fuel-based heating systems to electric-based heating and cooling systems.</p><p>Mr Porter explained the goal of the <a href=#>energy</a> efficiency program <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to MassLive News</a>.</p><p>“What we are trying to do, recognizing that energy-efficient appliances will save customers money over time – because they’ll use less energy and thus lower utility <a href=#>bills</a>,</p><p>"They often times come with higher upfront costs and so we try to use the <a href=#>rebates</a> and incentives in order to encourage customers to save money and save energy over time," said Mr Porter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>In order to receive your rebate for energy-efficient household appliances, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Save</a> outlined that rebate forms must be in by February 28, 2023 with supporting documentation.</p><h2>Rebates and incentives</h2><p>Residents who choose to become more energy efficient will benefit from the rebates.</p><p>The changes are

Compact, Eversource, Liberty Utilities, National Grid, or Unitil is the Program Sponsor.</p><p>Massachusetts residents in municipal electric territories are also eligible for energy rebates if they're a natural gas heating customer of one of the sponsors of Mass Save.</p><p>Homeowners need to have their "ENERGY STAR certified" equipment purchased and installed by a licensed contractor before December 31.</p><p>The equipment eligible for the rebate through Mass Save must also be new and installed to replace oil, propane, natural gas, or electric baseboard as the primary heating system, according to the site.</p><p>If the energy-saving equipment is installed in individual units in residential complexes of five units or more, that resident would not be eligible for whole-home rebates.</p><p>Even if someone's occupying a unit in a one to four unit building that's part of larger complex, they wouldn't be eligible for whole-home rebates but may receive the partial-home rebate amounts.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US
