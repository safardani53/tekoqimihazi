I’m the same! I hate bras and mine are always ready to poke someone’s eye out lol&nbsp;#freethenips."</p><p>Another fan responded to Gabby's caption, writing: "That’s not called selling your dignity girl, you’re makin' room for new stuff."</p><p>While a third jokingly asked: "How much are you selling the dignity for?? I’m running out of my own supply."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Elsewhere in the comment section, fans were mixed over the reality star's new hair color.</p><p>One person commented: "Not liking the blonde on you. The darker color is more attractive my opinion."</p><p>A second agreed, writing: "You’re beautiful, but not digging the blonde hair."</p><p>"Hi blondie!!!!" exclaimed an excited commenter.</p><p>While a fourth person wrote: "Loving the blonde Gabby!"</p><h2>GABBY'S JOURNEY</h2><p>The former Denver Broncos cheerleader was one of two bachelorettes in season 19 of The Bachelorette.</p><p>She ended the season with a fiancé,&nbsp;<a href=#>Erich Schwer</a>, from the show, but they announced on November 4, 2022, that they'd called it quits.</p><p>Gabby is originally from O'Fallon,&nbsp;<a href=#>Illinois</a>&nbsp;but moved to&nbsp;<a href=#>Colorado</a>, where she was hired as a cheerleader for&nbsp;<a href=#>NFL's</a>&nbsp;Denver Broncos.</p><p>She cheered for the team from 2016 through the end of the 2019-2020 season.</p><p>However, aside from her rise as a well-known reality&nbsp;TV&nbsp;personality, Gabby worked as a nurse for three years before joining the Denver Broncos in 2016.</p><p>She used her experience during the&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid-19 pandemic</a>&nbsp;and her nursing experience to assist where hospitals were short-staffed and in dire need of help.</p><p>During that time, she worked 12 hours or more. She won the Pop Warner Humanitarian Award in 2020– alongside the Cleveland Chiefs lineman Laurent Duvernay-Tardif – making her the first woman to receive the award.</p><p>Typically, only NFL players receive the award.</p><p>Pop Warner Little Scholars released a press statement at the time: "Windey and Duvarney-Tardif's selflessness and commitment to helping others are an embodiment of sacrifice and teamwork, making them model representatives for young student-athletes across the nation."</p><p>She moved on to reality TV when she appeared as a contestant on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, where she competed for&nbsp;<a href=#>Clayton Echard's</a>&nbsp;heart.</p><p>After Echard proposed to another woman, Gabby went on to find love as one of two bachelorettes on season 19 of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>.</p><p>She ended the season with an engagement to Erich Schwer. She spoke about her family life while on the show, revealing she isn't close to her mom.</p><p>However, less than two months after the season ended,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>&nbsp;reported that they were calling off their engagement.</p><p>"She felt they weren't aligned and weren't on the same page," the insider told E!</p><p>"Gabby was hoping they could give each other space and work it out but ultimately decided they didn't have a future."</p><h2>BACHELORETTES</h2><p>Gabby appeared alongside&nbsp;<a href=#>Rachel Recchia</a>&nbsp;in season 19 of The Bachelorette.</p><p>It was the first time two women appeared on the show simultaneously, and the men could pick which woman they wanted to pursue.</p><p>This was not without some drawbacks, as contestant&nbsp;<a href=#>Logan Palmer</a>&nbsp;told Rachel he was switching to pursue Windey instead.</p><p>He told Rachel: "I have feelings for Gabby…. I'm going to have to step away from pursuing things with you."</p><p>In an&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post, Logan apologized to Rachel and wrote: "I'm sorry that I added more difficulty to an already challenging journey.</p><p>"That was never my intention, but it was inspiring how strong you were through it all."</p><p>Windey did eventually choose Erich Schwer, who got down on one knee in the season finale despite him expressing his doubts in the previous episode.</p><p>"I think I want to date you," Erich told Gabby after hometown, confessing he wasn't sure if he was ready to propose.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Windey later told producers: "He said, 'I want to continue to date you.' That doesn't scream; I want to propose.</p><p>"What am I supposed to do? Walk away because he doesn't want to propose?" Gabby asked before calling the event a "dumpster fire" and a "big mess."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/silk-slip-bachelorette-dwts-finalist-808053981.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/already-bachelorette-fans-spot-major-756818881.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/dancing-stars-gabby-windey-val-760816638.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaGWFcYKVaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWUrMG0ecWipZqkmajBbrPAm5myZaeeu6Wx2Gaqrp6Wmr%2B0edaaqZ2qn5eybrnApZ2uppOptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-harley-bird-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Harley Bird Dating Now</span></a>
