After breaking out on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;in the 90s, he’s gone on to star in some of the most beloved and hilarious movies of all time, including Tommy Boy, Joe Dirt,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Grown Ups&nbsp;movies. Besides his movies and TV shows, David hosts his talk show&nbsp;Lights Out.&nbsp;He’s guest-hosted&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise,&nbsp;and he will also host the new game show&nbsp;Snake Oil.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Outside of comedy, David’s love-life has inspired much public discussion. He’s been romantically linked to tons of A-list stars, including the likes of&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Heather Locklear</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Naya Riviera.&nbsp;</strong></a>He also has a daughter&nbsp;<strong>Harper&nbsp;</strong>with his ex&nbsp;<strong>Jillian Grace.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>David has certainly gained a bit of a reputation for his romances with beautiful actresses. He opened up about the public perception in a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. “I think it was more played up because I didn’t seem like this guy that goes out with girls at all so if there’s one or two pretty ones it’s so astounding, everyone freaks out and you write an article, ‘Oh a pretty girl went out with this guy!’” he said. With the premiere of Snake Oil,&nbsp;look back on David’s long dating history.</p><h2>Kristy Swanson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-kristy-swanson-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>One of David’s earliest romances came when he co-starred with&nbsp;<strong>Kristy Swanson&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag.&nbsp;The two were together for about nine months from 1996 to 1997, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nicki Swift</a>.&nbsp;Despite the split, the actress said that she still thought he was “awesome” in a 2002 interview with&nbsp;<strong>Howard Stern.&nbsp;</strong>“I think we were better friends than we were dating,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the 90s and early aughts, there were many women that David was pals with that he was rumored to have dated, including his friend <strong>Krista Allen.</strong></p><h2>Lara Flynn Boyle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-lara-flynn-boyleembed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Back in the 90s, David had a relationship with&nbsp;Twin Peaks&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Lara Flynn Boyle,&nbsp;</strong>who also had a memorable role in the <i>SNL-</i>inspired&nbsp;movie&nbsp;Wayne’s World.&nbsp;Unfortunately, their romance came to an end when another star asked Lara out:&nbsp;<strong>Jack Nicholson.&nbsp;</strong>David revealed that&nbsp;The Shining&nbsp;star asked her out in front of him in a 2015 interview with&nbsp;Details Magazine.&nbsp;He said that the actress was angry he “didn’t stick up for her,” when Jack asked. “I said, ‘I’ve been in this town long enough to know when I’m outranked. You’re either gonna go out with him or you’re not,'” he recalled, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The&nbsp;Tommy Boy&nbsp;star admitted that he learned that Lara had gone out with Jack when The National Enquirer&nbsp;called him. He said that the two didn’t speak much after the split.</p><h2>Teri Hatcher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-teri-hatcher-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Another actress that David was rumored to have dated is&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teri Hatcher.</a>&nbsp;</strong>While neither of them have publicly commented on the rumors, they did appear in an&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;sketch together “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spade in America</a>” in 1996. In the hilarious sketch, they played each other, with Teri as David interviewing David as Teri. In the sketch, David flirted with the actress (as she was dressed as him), but she jokingly shot him down in her response. “There is no way that you, Teri Hatcher, would find me, David Spade, remotely attractive,” she quipped.</p><h2>Julie Bowen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-julie-bowen-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>In the early 2000s, David dated future&nbsp;Modern Family&nbsp;actress&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Julie Bowen</a>.&nbsp;</strong>She revealed the story of their relationship when she was a guest on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fly on the Wall&nbsp;</a>podcast in May 2023. She playfully joked about their relationship during the appearance. She revealed that David’s publicist had reached out to her to try to keep them in touch, and she initially avoided the call. After he was attacked by his personal assistant in 2000, Julie said that she called him back, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cracked</a>.&nbsp;“I called him and I was like, ‘Hey, are you all right? I just saw you got tased by Skippy.’ And you said, ‘Now will you go out with me?’” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Based on the podcast appearance, it’s clear the former pair have stayed friends despite the split. Julie does seem to enjoy teasing the&nbsp;Grown Ups&nbsp;actor, poking fun at their relationship in interviews. “I love him and I talk to him a lot and I will say this to his face, he’s a lovely person and a good friend, not a great boyfriend,” she said on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Life is Short With Justin Long</a>&nbsp;in 2020. “Maybe that’s not who you want to date. He needs to be free.”</p><h2>Brittany Daniel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-britanny-daniel-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>After David and&nbsp;<strong>Brittany Daniel&nbsp;</strong>co-starred in 2001’s&nbsp;Joe Dirt,&nbsp;there were some dating rumors about the on-screen couple. While the two have never said whether or not there was any romantic spark, the actress did admit that they’re very close in a 2015 interview with&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TooFab,</a>&nbsp;after the sequel came out. “He’s one of my closest friends and I’ll be friends with him forever. I care deeply for him,” she said.</p><h2>Heather Locklear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-heather-locklear-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>While Heather Locklear may be known for her romances with rockstars&nbsp;<strong>Tommy Lee&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Richie Sambora,&nbsp;</strong>she also enjoyed laughs with the comic for a brief time. After separating from Richie, she had a brief fling with David in 2006. While their romance was in the mid-aughts, David revealed that they first crossed paths when Heather was on&nbsp;SNL.&nbsp;“She was on&nbsp;SNL once, hosting, when I was a writer,” he told&nbsp;<strong>Andy Cohen&nbsp;</strong>in a 2018 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a>. “She goes, ‘I remember you.’ I go, ‘There’s not a chance.’ She remembered me, and I was some goofy writer, walking around, not getting any sketches on, of course. Just like, mesmerized by her, growing up on her, loving her. Ran into her later and we were friendly, and then we started hanging out. But she’s always so chirpy and fun and hilarious.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In that&nbsp;Radio Andy&nbsp;interview, David admitted that he still checked in on his ex from time to time, and it’s clear that things ended on good terms. Years after they broke up, Heather was asked about her ex at the airport by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;She was also very complimentary to him. “He’s always with beautiful, famous actresses,” she said. “Number one, he’s funny.”</p><h2>Jillian Grace</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-harper-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>David briefly dated&nbsp;Playboy Playmate&nbsp;Jillian Grace in 2008. While their romance was short, the two remain connected, because they share a daughter Harper. After the pair split, Jill revealed that she was pregnant in January 2008, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;She gave birth in September of that year. “David and Jillian have been in close contact throughout her pregnancy and he plans to go see the baby during his first break from shooting&nbsp;Rules of Engagement,”&nbsp;his rep said in a&nbsp; statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;at the time.</p><h2>Nicolette Sheridan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-nicolette-sheridan-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Teri Hatcher isn’t the only&nbsp;Desperate Housewives&nbsp;star that David was linked to! The comic appeared to have a brief fling with&nbsp;<strong>Nicolette Sheridan&nbsp;</strong>in 2008. The two were reportedly seen “cuddling and kissing” during a night out at Luau in Los Angeles, according to a report from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HuffPost</a>.&nbsp;“They were full-on making out in a booth,” a source told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Despite the report, Nicolette later denied the claims that they were dating in a 2009 interview on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</a> “We’re friends. We’re not dating,” she said. “Do you see us together?” David later admitted to being friends and hanging out a few times in a later interview.</p><h2>Naya Rivera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-spade-dating-history-naya-rivera-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>In April 2017, David sparked romance speculation when he was spotted cozying up to late Glee&nbsp;star Naya Rivera in a pool in Hawaii, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight.</a> The pair never officially confirmed their romance, but the actress seemed to poke fun at the rumors in an Instagram Story at the time. “The Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny are for sure dating you guys, I just saw it,” she wrote, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;Months later though, David was spotted smooching a different woman, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail.</a>&nbsp;Naya died in an accidental drowning in July 2020.</p><h2>His Current Relationship Status</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>In more recent years, David has played his love life closer to the vest. Though, that hasn’t stopped speculation. He was briefly rumored to be with Baywatch&nbsp;actress <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Charlotte McKinney,</a>&nbsp;</strong>when they were seen out to dinner in 2016, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. He also helped her with jokes for her standup comedy debut, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Maxim</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Amid the COVID pandemic, David did admit that he had a girlfriend, but he didn’t divulge many details. While he quarantined alone, he did admit to seeing his lady friend. “I’m dating someone now,” he told&nbsp;Page Six&nbsp;at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KxosLInWSsqJGZsm6wwK2gp59dlnqptdKtpquxXaSzbrTIrGSpmaOpeqi10aWdq6GVo7G0eZRqbXBsYml8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tray-savage-19930704-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tray Savage (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
