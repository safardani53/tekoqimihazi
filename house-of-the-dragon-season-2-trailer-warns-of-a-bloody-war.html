The one-minute trailer includes several dramatic clips of our favorite characters in Westeros.</p><p>It’s been more than a year since the show debuted, so let’s remember that the first season of the drama (which follows the Targaryen family 200 years before the events in <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>) left off with chaos following King Viserys’ (<strong>Paddy Considine</strong>) death. Alicent Hightower (<strong>Olivia Cooke</strong>) helped her son Aegon II Targaryen (<strong>Tom Glynne-Carney</strong>) usurp the Iron Throne. His half-sister (and Alicent’s former best friend) Rhaenyra Targaryen (<a href=#><strong>Emma D’Arcy</strong></a>) wanted to avoid a war and negotiate with her younger brother despite Viserys clearly naming her his heir. However, Lucerys Velaryon (<strong>Elliot Grihault</strong>) was killed by Aemond Targaryen’s (<strong>Ewan Mitchell</strong>) dragon, ending any good will Rhaenyra had toward Alicent and her half-siblings.</p><p>In the House of the Dragon season 2 trailer, Rhaenyra looks out at the water broodingly while Aegon walks toward the Iron Throne. Otto Hightower (<strong>Rhys Ifans</strong>) is heard saying, “Errors were made in the hours following King Viserys’ death.”</p><p>They are preparing for battle. Troops hold green shields and black flags to indicate their allegiances. Daemon Targaryen (<strong>Matt Smith</strong>) suits up in armor while Criston Cole (<strong>Fabien Frankel</strong>) beheads someone, presumably a Rhaenyra supporter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-trailer-warns-of-a-bloody-war-04.jpg><p>Alicent doesn’t seem concerned about the bloodshed. “The war will be fought, many will die, and the victor will eventually ascend the throne,” she says.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rhaenys Targaryen (<strong>Eve Best</strong>) tells Rhaenyra, “There is no war so hateful to the gods as a war between kin, and no war so bloody as a war between dragons.”</p><p>New posters for season 2 seemingly give Rhaenyra and Alicent different tag lines. While Rhaenyra’s poster reads “Fire to fire,” Alicent’s says “Blood for blood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-trailer-warns-of-a-bloody-war-02.jpg><p>Along with the new posters and trailer, HBO also confirmed several new <a href=#>cast members for House of the Dragon</a>‘s second season, including: <strong>Clinton Liberty</strong> as Addam of Hull, <strong>Jamie Kenna</strong> as Ser Alfred Broome, <strong>Kieran Bew</strong> as Hugh, <strong>Tom Bennett</strong> as Ulf, <strong>Tom Taylor</strong> as Lord Cregan Stark and <strong>Vincent Regan</strong> as Ser Rickard Thorne.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Previously announced new cast members include <strong>Abubakar Salim</strong> as Alyn of Hull, <strong>Gayle Rankin</strong> as Alys Rivers, <strong>Freddie Fox</strong> as Ser Gwayne Hightower, <strong>Simon Russell Beale</strong> as Ser Simon Strong.</p><p>House of the Dragon season 2, which will include eight episodes, is set to debut in summer 2024, two years after the first season debuted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2BoraOaerCyjK2fnmWUp66ou81mqp6Zo6S7bn6MramaoZyav27DwKulrGWfm3qiecGlpqicqWLEor6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-magnus-midtbo-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Magnus Midtbo Dating Now</span></a>
