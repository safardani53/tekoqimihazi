Makes you even more unique. #likeyouevenmore,” one replied.</p><h2>'MY WANDERING EYE'</h2><p>Andy is not afraid to open up about what he calls his "wandering eye."</p><p>He once shared that a boss told him he'd “never make it on camera" because of his eye. But he learned to embrace it.</p><p>“When I wound up getting on air, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is so harsh. I’m horribly deformed,’” he said on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Be Amazing</a>&nbsp;podcast in 2017.</p><p>“I called my mom. I was like, ‘I’m deformed.’ And she was like, ‘You do not have a wandering eye.’</p><p>And I go, ‘No, I do. I promise you. People are telling me across the country.’”</p><p>He continued, "I was always pretty vain, but I think it's weird there's a [TV] monitor right under my camera..."</p><p>"But ultimately on a scale of disastrous people that I've come in contact with, I give myself props that I have not become a complete nightmare or disaster. And I think I'm pretty nice to my staff still and stuff like that."</p><h2>ANDY APPOLOGIZES TO RYAN</h2><p>Meanwhile, during his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirius XM show</a>, the Andy Cohen Live host revealed he was "feeling" the consequences of being "just stupid and drunk" on New Year's.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;</a>host thought he went too far when he mentioned&nbsp;<a href=#>American Idol</a>&nbsp;host Ryan.</p><p>Andy said: "The only thing that I regret saying, the only thing is that I slammed the ABC broadcast."</p><p>He added: "I really like Ryan Seacrest," and then described him as "a great guy."</p><p>Just before the ball dropped in&nbsp;<a href=#>Times Square</a>, New York, Andy told&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson</a>, 54: "If you look behind me, you’ll see Ryan Seacrest’s group of losers performing.&nbsp;</p><p>He&nbsp;added: "I’m sorry but if you’re watching ABC, you’re watching nothing."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>CNN sources who spoke to Radar said Andy may have taken his last shot: "Nothing has been made official yet, but internally we have been told that Andy will not be invited back next year.</p><p>Andy joined the New Year's Eve telecast in 2017, replacing Kathy Griffin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/2c8c10b3-26ab-4502-b631-9cab63e8c0df.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/df42e985-abd5-46fa-9d6f-ab712a1bc475.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/b691b4c4-9346-4a63-a6b5-1c11fee3c2e6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703387545.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000702873091.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Andy Cohen 'banned' by CNN from ever hosting NYE special again after 'embarrassing' drunken rant with Anderson Cooper</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY26DcYWRaJinnKlisLC0xKdknKqfqMBusdiem2acoqq7rHnNnq5msZWWv7R50bKYp2Wjmq6kvsSsq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-lifeson.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Lifeson</span></a>
