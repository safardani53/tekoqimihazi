coach is using group masturbation and massages down there to improve the love lives of her clients.</p><p>Victoria Louise Smith, who is originally from England but now practises her unusual skills in Australia's Gold Coast, claims to "perform sex magic to help transformations in relationships”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408333410.jpg><p>Having obtained a degree in counselling an coaching, the 27-year-old aims to&nbsp;improve her clients' relationship with themselves and others by “making changes on a cellular level through the body".</p><p>Victoria and her 26-year-old partner, Danny, co-host 'self pleasure workshops', where they teach people to explore their sexuality and learn to become in tune with their bodily desires and sensations.</p><p>Victoria said: “Come and help rid our society of shame and taboo around sexuality and come back to your own erotic innocence.”</p><p>The mixed and single gender sessions cost $65, about £37, and Victoria&nbsp;verbally guides the circle through a masturbation session.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408334124.jpg><p>On occasion, she even performs physical demonstrations.</p><p>Victoria claims there are a range of benefits to come out of the group sessions, including "strengthening the bond between the women and their yoni (vaginas) and helping them learn about pleasure".</p><p>She also says the classes can also help attendees reach profound orgasmic states and can also help to awaken erectile tissue for more pleasure during sex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408334025.jpg><p>People at Victoria and Danny's sessions are advised to bring oil, a towel, a blanket and a sarong.</p><p>Women and men between the ages of 21 and 80 attend the sessions, in the hopes of learning to connect with others and transform their relationships.</p><p>Victoria said: “I help others find freedom through sexuality.”</p><p>As well as the pleasure side to the circles, some experience a therapeutic element, which Victoria says helps heal some of past sexual violations and can transform uncomfortable sexual emotional states into more positive and wholesome emotions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408334005.jpg><p>According to Victoria, one of the main aims of the pleasure circle is to&nbsp;help people attract and obtain partners who can satisfy them both sexually and emotionally.</p><p>Clients are then able to "call in partners that appreciate them and know their worth".</p><p>The couple share images of their circles and positive messages about sexual freedom <a href=#>on their Instagram.</a></p><p>One post on the account features Danny covered in Victoria's menstrual blood in order to make a statement addressing the stigma around period blood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408333518.jpg><p>Victoria said: “The image represents that as a society we need to get more comfortable with a woman’s cycle.</p><p>“I feel as if we are constantly forced to hide our cycle and its a pretty huge part of our lives as women.</p><p>"Men can show their support by being comfortable with our blood and not being disgusted by it.”</p><p>Victoria says she was first inspired to launch the workshops after she was "able to heal" her own sexuality after an abusive relationship left her out of touch with herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408333423.jpg><p>She now works with people who suffer from a range of conditions relating to sexual trauma, sexual dysfunction and others who are simply interested in pleasure expansion.</p><p>Victoria, who is a fully qualified sex coach also provides yoni (vagina) massages to women in the aim of providing healthy energy to enable healing.</p><p>This very up close and personal massage works when it's combined with a tantric massage on the whole body in order to help women reach a heightened level of sexuality.</p><p>When asked what advice she has for anyone that wants to learn more about Somatic sex coaching and tantric sex she said: “Get a coach, and stay committed to the journey. Tantric embodiment doesn't happen over night.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5VsbHBsZWt8rrHErWStoJViwaK606ugnGWnnsGktIywn6hlpaiytHnSnq9mpZGctqR5xqumrqhdoq60wNSrmZqsmaS7bq3NnWSmmaOorqix0mabqK%2BeYsGpsdGeZK2nXZ66sb7Or5xmoJWneqS4yJ6lratdoby3sYyloK%2Bdo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derrick-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Derrick Jones: Career, Family &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]</span></a>
