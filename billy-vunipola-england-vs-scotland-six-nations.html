I went to an RFU disciplinary conference a few years later and said I had done my bit to improve English discipline&nbsp; by sending Billy Vunipola off!</p><p>“People laughed a lot but he’s not been in trouble since. I&nbsp; like to think he saw the light from that red card.</p><p>“As he has gone on, he has come up against players bigger than him and&nbsp; has had to moderate his attitude. And he is an amazing player for it.</p><p>“He used to&nbsp; run through sides. He’d&nbsp; run up to the tryline and wait for someone to come up to him, pass the ball to them and let them score a try.</p><p>“I am only sorry he did not decide to play for Wales instead of England.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000218433179.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000307564621.jpg><p>Billy and Mako could have both played for the Welsh&nbsp; having left Tonga in 1998, when their dad Fe’ao was recruited by Jonah Lomu’s old agent to come and play for Pontypool.</p><p>From a young age it was clear the terrorising Tongan two were special talents. Not only were they twice the size of their team-mates — but they also had the skills to match.</p><p>The brothers would often shock and amaze watching parents as they tore it up at Thornbury RFC.</p><p>Their old PE teacher Lloyd Spacey at The Castle School was among those awestruck.</p><p>Spacey said: “When Billy came to us at 11 years old, he was doing things most adult rugby players would be doing. He would&nbsp; do spin passes accurately over 40 yards.</p><p>“He kicked out of hand beautifully, took the conversions and penalties as his place-kicking was fantastic.</p><p>“Billy slotted a few drop-goals too. It all came easy to him. Once he kicked the ball from a restart, caught it again on the 22 and strolled over for a try.</p><p>“Mako was just as skilful. He played loosehead for the school but would reverse pass the ball 25 metres.</p><p>“Their skills stood out&nbsp; as well as their work ethic and&nbsp; their dad had a lot to do with that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000307591560.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000307596994.jpg><p>Mum Singa is also a huge driving force behind the brothers’ success. But she admits still getting stick for her sons&nbsp; wearing the Red Rose of England.</p><p>She said: “After training as a&nbsp; Methodist minister in Cardiff there was a vacancy in Thornbury, so they decided to send me over the Bridge.</p><p>“That was the beginning of the ‘traitors’ name-calling from my friends back in Wales!</p><p>“Their grandfather was the one who put the dream into them, saying: ‘Next time I come over, you will be playing for England’. That is how it began.</p><p>“My husband knew all along that they had the talent. It was just the method of working hard.”</p><p>Both brothers have defied the odds to get fit after knee injuries and help&nbsp; England hunt another&nbsp; Grand Slam.</p><p>Explaining their dogged nature, prop Mako said: “Growing up, dad wouldn’t accept we were hurt in any game.</p><p>“If either of us go down in a game the other one will come over and say, ‘Get back up’.”</p><p>In two days it will be the Scots who the brothers will look to floor.</p><p>Tweet @SunJonnyFordham</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZIBxgJVxZ2tnkp65rcWMr6ynoaCkuaJ5xKeepZmemXq3v4ysmqisnJa7pXnSoq9mppGptrC60mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./morgan-wade-no-signs-slowing-down-tickets.html><span>←</span><span>Morgan Wade No Signs Of Slowing Down tour: How can I buy tickets?</span></a>
