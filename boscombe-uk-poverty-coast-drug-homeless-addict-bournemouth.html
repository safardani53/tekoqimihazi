People used to attack me for begging, it happened more than 10 times. I’m no saint but I never stole, I just wanted help,” Jose said.</p><p>The beatings left him with such severe anxiety and panic attacks that he’s now on medication full-time and his body shakes while talking to us.</p><p>“I started using drugs when I was eight and by 14 I had tried heroin to take away the pain from my life, thankfully now I’ve been clean for six months,” he added.</p><h2>Millionaires' row nearby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000612849142.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000743983467.jpg><p>While Jose has accommodation now, another obstacle is finding work - he “lost another job” yesterday and claimed he “couldn’t afford to live” off the salary.</p><p>Meanwhile, just seven miles away is Sandbanks, a favourite for celebrities and retired footballers.</p><p>On <a href=#>Panorama Road</a>, one of the most affluent parts of the area, the 'average' mansion sells for £5.7million and sometimes more.</p><p>It's been <a href=#>dubbed "millionaires' playground"</a> because of the sky-high in this elite community.</p><p>Among them was <a href=#>Harry Redknapp</a>’s <a href=#>luxury home - which boasted a pool, sauna, gym and home cinema – and it sold for £10million</a> last year.</p><p>Financial worries in Boscombe, though, are all too common with residents like Chris Worthington-Foxley, 34, who moved into shared accommodation to survive the <a href=#>cost of living crisis</a>.</p><p>“The amount we are being charged is insane. You’re looking at up 60 per cent of your wage to cover bills,” says the part-time cleaner.</p><p>“If you’re on benefits you’re given £350 towards a room and you won’t find one for that or not one that you could live in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>“Boscombe has a reputation of being a bit of a crack den and there are some colourful characters but you don’t see much trouble apart from people shouting and stumbling around.</p><p>“I’m planning to move to Spain because there are so few reasons to stay here anymore and it’s all to do with landlords and monopolies, it’s mental.”</p><h2>'I'd starve if it wasn't for food banks'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000743988353.jpg><p>Janine Banks fears she would starve if it wasn't for food banks after losing her job and becoming homeless last August.&nbsp;</p><p>“During my last six months in a private flat, I was struggling financially and had to ask for help to pay my rent,” she explained.</p><p>“Then I lost my job and a gentleman offered me a lifeline by letting me move but he was emotionally abusive so I had to leave and now I’m homeless.”</p><p>I’ve hit rock bottom.

I would have to go hungry and stop eating otherwise.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000743983771-1.jpg><p>The 53-year-old sleeps in her tent on the hills that overlook Boscombe beach – but previously she slept underneath the pier and in shop doorways.</p><p>Janine said: “I’ve been attacked twice. Disgustingly, during one attack a group of retired people walked past and I heard one say ‘Leave her alone, she’s not worth it, she’s homeless.’</p><p>During one attack a group of retired people walked past and on said ‘Leave her alone, she’s not worth it, she’s homeless’</p><span class=quote-credit>Janine Banks</span><p>“Now I feel a lot safer, I’ve found a quiet place in the hills, no one knows I’m there and while I am getting robbed I can deal with it.”</p><p>She’s living on “a small amount” from Universal Credit and claims she’s been unable to access a refuge or council housing because of an eight-month waiting list.</p><h2>'I quit a life of crime after pal's suicide'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000743983417.jpg><p>Around 20,000 students enroll at the two universities in Boscombe's neighbouring town Bournemouth each year.</p><p>Locals want people “born and brought up” in the area to be helped on to the property ladder rather than landlords looking to extend their property portfolios.</p><p>It’s a thought echoed by many we spoke to, who believe talented locals that could make a difference are being forced out.</p><p>One such young resident is Marcus Goncalves, 22, who admits Boscombe is “a tough environment” but it’s also “full of diversity, culture and exciting people”.</p><p>“The people here are struggling because we’ve been forgotten about and live in an area that’s known for being a s***hole,” he said.</p><p>“It feels like there’s a war on the people here. We need help not incriminate. Boscombe's reputation means people avoid coming here.</p><p>“I’ve made many of my best friends here and have seen some of those best friends die here too because help is not there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000743983442.jpg><p>Former shoplifter Marcus decided to turn his life around after a friend took his own life while secretly battling depression and drug addiction.</p><p>“He died because he didn't have the right people there to support him and because of prejudice against people from this area,” the McDonald’s worker said.</p><p>“People fear what they don't understand and are scared but most people are good and have got caught up in the wrong place.</p><p>“In the past, I never had money to buy clothes so I used to take what I wanted. I used to get into trouble but I don’t commit crime anymore.</p><p>“Fortunately, I’ve found a support worker who has guided me to the right place and I'm working on saving up money for a flat.”</p><h2>'I was a homeless addict, we just want love'</h2><p>Charity worker Paul Coombes agrees – he first became homeless at the age of 14 and only moved to Boscombe in a bid to give up drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>After a stint in rehab and joining the church, he managed to overcome his addiction and now uses his “pain to help others”.</p><p>“I remember taking doormats, piling them up around a toilet and sleeping there.
