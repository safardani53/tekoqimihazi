Whitney has denied the claims.</p><p class=p1>“For those who have watched the 1st episode of #rhoslc on @bravotv … there is something I want to correct,” she<a href=#> tweeted</a> after the episode aired. “Contrary to what one of my cast mates stated, I WAS NOT EXCOMMUNICATED from the Mormon church. I chose to walk away. … Although I no longer identify as a Mormon, I still have a deep love and admiration for all of my Mormon friends and family.”</p><p class=p1>Whitney and Justin <a href=#>renewed their vows</a> in 2020, which was filmed for the debut season of <i>RHOSLC</i>.</p><p class=p1>“The vow renewal was happening regardless of the show,” she told <a href=#>E</a><i><a href=#>ntertainment Tonight</a> a</i>t the time. “That was something that Justin and I said, we always joked that if we made it to the 10-year mark — which in and of itself being a second marriage and an affair, we already beat, like, every odd against us, right? So, <a href=#>here we are</a> and it was important to us to celebrate that.”</p><p class=p1>While <i>RHOSLC</i> season 4 will follow Whitney and Justin’s <a href=#>ups and downs</a>, the new episodes will also see the return of costar <a href=#><strong>Mary Cosby</strong></a> after her season 2 exit. “Here I am! Somebody rescue me quick,” Mary, 50, quipped in a confessional before walking into <a href=#><strong>Meredith Marks</strong></a>’ boutique — asking if “somebody farted.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>RHOSLC </i>also stars <a href=#><strong>Lisa Barlow</strong></a>, Marks, 51, and newcomer <strong>Monica Garcia</strong>.</p><p class=p1><i>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i> premieres on Bravo Tuesday, September 5, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsG6%2FxJqqqKZdaXq1vsCio56qXay1qsDNnrBmqp%2Bosm7AxJqqnqtdn8K0wMinZKaZoqe2orPEZqurp6WXuaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-jackie-deangelis.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jackie DeAngelis? | The US Sun</span></a>
