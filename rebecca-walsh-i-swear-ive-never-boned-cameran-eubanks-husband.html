But then, we’ve all seen them on our screens.</p><p>"The allegations that this rumor was started by Kathryn Dennis are even more hurtful," she expresses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>‘I met Kathryn one time in July 2018," Rebecca recalls.</p><p>She writes that she met the Southern Charm star "when I did her makeup for a photoshoot for a local clothing store."</p><p>"I have not seen or spoken to Kathryn since," Rebecca then affirms.</p><p>Though she does not personally accuse Kathryn of fabricating this affair story, she is acknowledging that Kathryn appears to be the rumor’s source.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Clearly, Rebecca feels deeply betrayed by the accusation and it’s apparent origins.</p><p>‘I have only known her in my limited interaction in a professional capacity," she says of Kathryn.</p><p>"And to suggest that I am somehow associated with these allegations," Rebecca expresses, "is dumbfounding, hurtful, and malicious."</p><p>It is hard to imagine what it must feel like to wake up and learn that you have been implicated in an affair with a man you’ve never even met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I am so sorry to the Wimberly family," Rebecca expresses.</p><p>She concludes by writing that she is heartbroken ‘that someone would cut so low as to attack the core tenant of anyone’s life – their family."</p><p>All in all, this was an extremely well-written denial. Not too long and not too short.</p><p>It’s especially impressive given that Rebecca is not a public figure and has presumably never written anything of this kind before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rebecca is not the only one who has shot down the claim that Cameran’s husband has had this affair.</p><p>Cameran herself railed against the claim that same day.</p><p>Though it is true that she is not returning to Southern Charm, she says that her husband has been entirely faithful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"You must protect what is sacred to you," Cameran wrote on Instagram in response to "fake articles."</p><p>"Some things," she remarked, "aren’t worth a big paycheck."</p><p>Cameran stated that she felt particularly dismayed that her husband was being maligned by these rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I can’t get too upset though," Cameran opined.</p><p>She continued: "because that is what you sign up for when you put your life on reality TV."</p><p>Cameran revealed to her fans that the fakery and nonstop drama was "why I am getting out of it now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Drama is needed to stay relevant on reality television," Cameran correctly observed.</p><p>"And sadly," she expressed, "false rumors about others are sometimes created."</p><p>"Make of that what you will," Cameran wrote, "and consider the source."</p><p>At this point, it almost sounds like Cameran is saying that Kathryn did invent this affair rumor and that it’s why she rage-quit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>However, Cameran shared: "My decision was made and given to Bravo months ago."</p><p>"And," she detailed, it "had absolutely nothing to do with ridiculous and fake rumors about my marriage."</p><p>Cameran implored her fans and followers to "please disregard any fabricated rumor."</p><p>"It’s a ploy," she accused, "for ratings."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Cameran concluded by thanking her genuine fans.</p><p>She is departing from the series after six years and she feels that her timing was wisely chosen.</p><p>It will be interesting to see what more comes of it. After those dual denials, we frankly do not expect to see any real evidence of an affair.</p><p>But perhaps we will at least learn the rumor’s origins.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Kathryn Dennis: I Can PROVE Thomas Ravenel is an Unstable Liar!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WCcL7Em5ycm5FixKK40qFkomWjrLKivoyirZ5lnprDpr6Mm6annZRisKK5xKuYp2WVqq%2BiusqsZKGto5eur7CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-eason-mugshot-arrest-assault-charges-jenelle-evans-husband-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Grins In Photo Hollywood Life</span></a>
