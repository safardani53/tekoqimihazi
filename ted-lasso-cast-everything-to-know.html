"It's really kind of folks to even consider that because you never know what's gonna happen when you make things. The fact that people want more, even if it's a different avenue, is lovely."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Apple TV+ series first premiered in August 2020 and viewers quickly became attached to Sudeikis' affable character Lasso, as well as the supporting acts that round out the star-studded cast. Similarly, the actors and actresses on the project developed quite a bond with one another — Sudeikis has called his Ted Lasso castmates his "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chosen family</a>," and several others have echoed his sentiment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon learning the news of her Emmy nomination in July 2021, Juno Temple told PEOPLE, "I'm just grateful that I get to go through this experience with an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>extraordinary team of people</a>, who all got recognition. The fact that we just all got these nominations, it's the greatest way it could happen because it's teamwork makes the dream work and we're a team."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cast of Ted Lasso, from L: Jeremy Swift, Phil Dunster, Brett Goldstein, Hannah Waddingham, Jason Sudeikis, Juno Temple, Nick Mohammed and Brendan Hunt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rich Fury/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, when accepting the 2022 SAG Award for best ensemble cast, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hannah Waddingham</a> joyfully called herself and her castmates a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>gaggle of idiots</a>." And when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Brett Goldstein</a> won the 2022 Critics Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor, he told the crowd, "Let's be honest, I'm basically the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>most supported actor</a>. Like, I don't do much. I'm just surrounded by an amazing cast."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, a few days after the premiere of season 3, several <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>members of the Ted Lasso cast visited the White House</a>. They spoke with President <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Joe Biden</a> and First Lady <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jill Biden</a> about the importance of mental health, and Sudeikis addressed the press in the briefing room.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"No matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter who you voted for, we all — probably, I assume — we all know someone who has ... struggled, that's felt isolated, that's felt anxious, that's felt alone," he said.

He was hired as a writer for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Saturday Night Live</a> in 2003. Two years later, in 2005, Sudeikis joined the SNL cast, often playing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Joe Biden</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Mitt Romney</a> and appearing in "Weekend Update" segments as the Devil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After leaving SNL in 2013, Sudeikis starred in Horrible Bosses, Horrible Bosses 2 and We're the Millers, as well as critically acclaimed films Colossal (with Oscar winner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anne Hathaway</a>), Downsizing, Sleeping With Other People and his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>then-fiancee</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Olivia Wilde</a>'s directorial debut Booksmart in 2019.

The show is largely Sudeikis' brainchild, and he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>credits Wilde with encouraging him to pursue the beloved series</a> he created. While accepting the Critics' Choice Awards for Best Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Comedy Series in March 2021, Sudeikis thanked his children and added, "I want to thank their mom Olivia, who had the initial idea to do this as a TV show, saying, 'You and Brendan [Hunt] and Joe [Kelly] like doing that so much, you should do it as a movie or TV show.' ... She was right."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2021, Sudeikis returned to his roots on the SNL stage as a host, reminiscing about his time on the NBC stalwart and joking that all it took to get SNL creator and executive producer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lorne Michaels</a> to notice him was a mega-successful TV show..</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Honestly, honestly, swear to God, I found myself giving the same advice to every single person," Sudeikis said. "I was just like, you know, 'Win an Emmy! And if you can, win two!' You know, double up. That's the best way to do it. It sets you up for success."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sudeikis has since won two more Emmys for the show and his portrayal as the earnest title character. As for his plans to continue portraying Ted Lasso after the series wraps up, the actor recently joked to Deadline: "I mean, there's always Cameo, right?"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hannah-waddingham-as-rebecca-welton></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hannah Waddingham as Rebecca Welton</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Hannah Waddingham.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Apple TV+</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hannah Waddingham</a> was born in London and grew up around music (her mother and maternal grandparents were professional opera singers). The star was a veteran actress and singer on the West End stage in her native Britain (and on Broadway in Spamalot) before landing the female lead role of Rebecca Welton, team owner, on Ted Lasso.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to her Ted Lasso screen star turn, Waddingham actually had memorable, if brief, parts on two other hit series. In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Game of Thrones</a>, Waddingham played the much-memed "Shame Nun" Septa Unella in the HBO smash for two seasons; she also appears as Jackson's mother in Netflix's Sex Education and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>had a small role in Hocus Pocus 2</a> alongside the classic Sanderson sisters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Bette Midler</a> and Kathy Najimy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her role of Rebecca has been her biggest yet, and Waddingham has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>made no secret about how life-changing Ted Lasso has been for her</a>. While accepting the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series, a tearful Waddingham thanked Sudeikis profusely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Jason, you've <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>changed my life</a> with this and more importantly my baby girl's. Honestly, I'm so privileged to work with you. "This single mum wouldn't be standing here without you," she said before shouting out her fellow London stage stars. "West End musical performers need to be on screen more. Please give them a chance 'cause we won't let you down."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of why Waddingham loves the role so much is how close to home it's hit for her, especially in the episode "No Weddings and a Funeral," which she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>filmed while her own father was undergoing heart surgery in real life</a>. While she appreciates the work, Waddingham joked that Sudeikis is a "nightmare" because he always makes her laugh during filming when her character is supposed to be straitlaced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Imagine playing Rebecca, where I'm meant to be this stoic ice queen. Imagine doing scenes when Jason has got the cheeky little pixie going on in his eye. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>He's a nightmare!</a> And so is Nick Mohammed," she added, "to the point where in Season 2 when Nick Mohammed and I have to do scenes together, we have to slightly look off the side of each other's faces."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like almost the entire rest of the world, Waddingham wishes Ted Lasso could go on forever. She previously told Entertainment Tonight of season 3 being the end of the road, "If I were Apple and Warner Bros., I'd be leaning on [Sudeikis] like a lunatic and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>putting him in a corner in a little cage</a> and giving him a notebook and a pen.

He began writing and performing plays when he was young and got his first taste of theater while studying film at the University of Warwick, all while still writing and performing his own material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During that time, he also tried his hand at being a stuntman. "I used to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pretend to be Indiana Jones</a> and jump off roofs and slide under garage doors. I was 29 at the time," he previously told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goldstein wrote and performed in a short romantic comedy called SuperBob, which caught the attention of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ricky Gervais</a>, leading to an audition and then the part of Tom in Gervais' TV show Derek in 2012. That opened more doors, eventually landing him a writing gig on Ted Lasso. He felt such a connection with the character of Roy Kent that he recorded his own audition videos for the part, obviously eventually landing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to his work on Ted Lasso, Goldstein is co-creator of AMC's Soulmates and has his own podcast, Films to Be Buried With — and he made his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut as Hercules in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>post-credit scene in Thor: Love and Thunder</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even with all of these well-deserved credits, Roy Kent remains the character for which Goldstein is best known. With Ted Lasso wrapping up, he told The Sunday Times what the show really means to him, if not necessarily for audiences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't speak for fans," he said.

In the series, Keeley is a model who becomes the team's publicity and marketing manager before she moves on and starts her own PR and marketing agency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Temple, the daughter of director Julian Temple and producer Amanda Pirie, is a London-born and bred actor who got her start as a child.

He taught Sudeikis about soccer while living in Amsterdam with series co-creator Joe Kelly, playing FIFA on PlayStation between improv gigs when their Boom Chicago troupe was based in the Netherlands city.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've been soccer-translating for Jason for a long-ass time," Hunt <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The Daily Beast</a> in 2020. "Because once I got into soccer, it was over. I was nuts. It was crazy and I became a missionary."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon returning to the United States, Hunt developed and starred in a one-man show about living as an American overseas, followed by Absolutely Filthy, based on a grown-up Pig Pen from Peanuts, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to LA Weekly</a>. In addition to theater work, Hunt starred in Key & Peele and appeared in Reno 911!, Community, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Parks and Recreation</a> and alongside Sudeikis in Horrible Bosses 2 and We're the Millers before launching Ted Lasso with Sudeikis and Kelly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One Ted Lasso script that resonates particularly strongly for Hunt is the season 1 speech the title character gives at the dartboard, where he quotes Walt Whitman and encourages everyone to "be curious, not judgmental."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One thing that being curious and not judgmental does is it has an ancillary effect of reminding you that a lot of anger isn't really worth it," Hunt told The Daily Beast.

And a lot of times it's just bad for you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of Ted Lasso's final season, Hunt appeared on Celebrity Jeopardy! and earned the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>highest Coryat score</a> (total winnings excluding wagers) in the entire series with a sum of $35,600.

While studying for his seismology Ph.D. at Cambridge University's Magdalene College, Mohammed joined the Footlights theater troupe and began performing gigs on tour with the group.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mohammed then ventured into solo performances, including a one-man show at The Fringe Festival in 2005 called Back In Town Again: - Waltzing out of town. Out of just three audience members, one was an agent, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>with whom Mohammed still works today</a>. He's performed several more solo shows since at the festival, including The Forer Factor (2006), 4uarters (2007), Nick Mohammed Is A Character Comedian (2008) and Apollo 21 (2009).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After signing with his agent, Mohammed began working in television with roles in series like Life's Too Short and The King Is Dead and sketch show Sorry I've Got Not Head, as well as in radio on BBC Radio 4's Quarters and Nick Mohammed In Bits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His first mainstream feature film debut came in 2015's The Martian as Tim Grimes, followed by Bridget Jones' Baby a year later. In 2018, Mohammed voiced Piglet in Disney's live-action Christopher Robin, but his major breakthrough came two years later. In 2020, he not only starred as Nate, but also costarred with Friends star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>David Schwimmer</a> in Intelligence on Sky One; a second season aired in 2021. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Deadline reports</a> that he'll next appear as a wise-cracking cop in Maggie Moore(s) with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Tina Fey</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jon Hamm</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mohammed lives in London's Richmond neighborhood, where Ted Lasso is based, but didn't move there for the series.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a weird old thing getting recognized and definitely something I'm still getting used to," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The Guardian</a> of adjusting to global fame. "Lots of people are pretty angry with Nate too, given how the last season of Ted Lasso ended — so managing that has been fun."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mohammed told PEOPLE that Nate's arc in the series gave him lots of opportunities to stretch his acting chops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was fun in a sense that, as an actor, you relish an opportunity to try something different," he said. "It was certainly challenging in that if I had a comfort area, it was in doing the slightly bumbling, awkward Nate, which I was able to find my way through that a lot easier because there were lots of jokes written into that. But then increasingly in Season 2, there were less written jokes for Nate and a lot <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>more emotional dramatic driven plots for him</a>, and particularly the latter half of Season 2, so it was definitely challenging."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "And then to find myself be the villain of the piece, I guess second to Rupert, who's the ultimate villain ... it's a fun place to start season 3 from, that's for sure."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-phil-dunster-as-jamie-tartt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-119 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Phil Dunster as Jamie Tartt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Apple TV+</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Phil Dunster, who stars as the obnoxious but inwardly vulnerable Jamie Tartt, was a kid growing up in Northampton, U.K., he thought sports were in his future — but not soccer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-123 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think the first thing that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I thought I would go and do as a career was a rugby player</a>," he told PEOPLE. "I had a trial with a club and it became very clear, very quickly that that wasn't going to be what I would end up doing. I was far too small and far too much of a lightweight, both mentally and physically, to play rugby at that level."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When rugby didn't pan out, Dunster considered following in the footsteps of his father and older brother and enlisting in the military, but that changed when he was 16 and got his first taste of acting in a radio play. He got his first professional screen acting credit in a small role in the 2013 film The Film-Maker's Son and graduated with an acting degree from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School the following year. He's appeared in several movies, including Megan Leavey, Murder on the Orient Express, Judy and The Good Liar, as well as in U.K. series Humans and Strike Back. His only comedy experience before Ted Lasso was two episodes of Catastrophe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-127 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dunster told PEOPLE that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gave Jamie a Manchester accent</a> in part thanks to inspiration from his girlfriend, filmmaker Eleanor Hayden, and her mother, as well as brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-129 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's quite nasally when they talk. It's like [everything] goes through the nose," he said of the accent. "For me, it's just as much about attitude. The accent, it's an inner-city accent. It has to be quick." He added, "My girlfriend's mom is born and raised in Manchester, and so I was worried that their family is going to be disowning me, but they were part of sort of my cultural references.

Season 2 was a major breakthrough for both Jimoh and his character, as he pursued a romantic relationship with Waddingham's Rebecca despite their differences in age and race — and both of those differences faded into the background as the series simply focused on who they are as individuals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-135 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's so much that could have been drawn out or milked about the storyline where you have a young black athlete dating an older white woman, and that just isn't important," Jimoh <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Deadline</a>. "Who they are as people is the most important thing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-137 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jimoh was born in the U.K., but moved to Nigeria when he was a baby, returning to London's Brixton neighborhood when he was seven years old.

"There are times where you kind of feel like you fall in between that crack. With my generation, there's a real resurgence of people who make being Black British its own thing. That's kind of where I found myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-141 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, prior to his global breakout in Ted Lasso, Jimoh had a star turn in the U.K. as Anthony Walker in Anthony, a reimagining of Walker's life had he not been murdered in a 2005 racist attack, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>per the BBC</a>. His next screen effort was The Feed on Prime Video, followed by the role of Sam, which made him a star on both sides of the pond and beyond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-143 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a soccer lover, Jimoh plays off-screen as well, and it's proven to be entertaining to Ted Lasso viewers who spot him in real life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-145 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The fans that you get from the show are really heartwarming people who just want to show you love and they're proud of your journey," he told Deadline, adding that fans often like watching him play soccer with his friends. "They stand and watch to see if I'm really any good and to see if the stunts on the show are CGI or not."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-147 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, Jimoh, spoke about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the friendships he's made</a> with the rest of the cast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-149 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We really have bonded. I think you can tell from the way we interact with each other, wherever we go, that there's a real genuine connection between all of us," Jimoh told PEOPLE.

When he graduated, he moved to England to pursue his master's degree and worked as a bartender to make ends meet.
