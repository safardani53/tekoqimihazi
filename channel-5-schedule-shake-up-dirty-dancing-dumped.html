Dirty Dancing had been due to air on Sunday afternoon but the much-loved 80s classic starring Patrick Swayze is no longer listed in the TV guide.
The cult classic, in which Swayze's dance instructor character Johnny strikes up a frowned upon romance with Jennifer Grey's Baby at a US holiday camp, is never far from a TV screen due to its popularity 36 years on from its release."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
