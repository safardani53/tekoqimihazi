He is gonna do it to Raquel. He's gonna do it to his next partner,” Kent said. “He's a soul-sucking human.”Doute added: “Who's only concerned with himself right now, and it's just bringing back so many memories.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kristen-Doute-Warns-Raquel-Leviss-‘Karma-Is-Coming-After-Tom-Sandoval-Affair-‘Move-Home-120.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Kristen Explains Her Relationship With Raquel]]>&lt;![CDATA[Doute, who has been spotted filming scenes for season 10 after she was let go by Bravo in 2020, noted that she previously stopped “hating” Leviss who dated her ex Kennedy for several years after a conversation at Kent’s daughter Ocean’s first birthday party in March 2022.“[Which] she wasn’t invited to, by the way,” Kent noted. “But [Scheana] is kind enough to pack up a pair of legs and half a torso and bring her.”Shay revealed that the duo were supposed to go to NYC to see Sandoval’s band, but the visit was canceled. After Doute admitted that she had “really never had an actual conversation with Raquel” until the birthday party, Kent joked: “Has she had an actual conversation with anybody without circuiting?”“Strangely, that day at Ocean's birthday party was the most intelligent and well-spoken and put together I had ever heard her be, without kind of barely blinking her eyes and just opening her mouth a lot,” Doute continued. “She and James had obviously broken up and she was willing to sort of commiserate with me on the way that he is and the things that he had done, and she was open to hearing a lot of my truth. And other than that day, I really haven't talked to her much at all. However, I have always thought that she and James are on the same exact level of being an opportunist. I had to remind myself that she was a fan of the show before she was on the show.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Scheana-Shay-Doesnt-Care-to-Repair-Friendship-With-Troll-Katie-Maloney.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Scheana Wants an Apology From Katie Maloney]]>&lt;![CDATA[Before Leviss and Sandoval’s relationship was revealed, she made out with Tom Schwartz at Shay’s wedding in August 2022. Schwartz’s ex-wife, Katie Maloney, wasn’t happy about the make out and blamed Shay for pushing the pair together.“The reunion should be very interesting because I think Katie's expecting an apology from me, but I'm also expecting an apology from her,” Shay said on Friday.She also hinted that the two women are putting their issues aside to be there for Madix. “We are a group of people who can band together for the bigger picture and put personal differences aside [to] be in a group chat together, be in the same room with one another because our st doesn't matter right now,” Shay said. “So for that, I am thankful."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lala-Kent-Clarifies-Comments-About-James-Kennedys-Girlfriend-Being-Forgettable-as-Pump-Rules-Cast-Weighs-In.jpg?quality=40&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Lala Feels Her Hands Are 'Clean' of Past Cheating With James]]>&lt;![CDATA[“James and I hooked up when my dad was, like, alive and kicking and the [reunion] where my dad had passed … she talks about how in her horrific polyester puffer sleeves, light a match too close to her, she was gonna fking melt … but she was like, ‘We really decided that our relationship started when we moved in together.’ A.k.a [when] he gave her two drawers,” Kent said. “So, like, technically we didn't cheat because my person was actually married. Very much so. I was a mistress, so you can't cheat on a married person and y'all started your relationship when you got two drawers. So we didn't cheat, hands clean, bye bitch!”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Scheana-Says-Pump-Rules-Reunion-Will-Need-Cages-Amid-Raquel-Lawsuit-0001223.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Lala and Scheana’s Post-Reunion Plans]]>&lt;![CDATA[“I can’t wait to after this reunion, just go to Palm Springs,” Shay said.Kent confirmed, “That’s what we’re doing. We’re sending the moms and the kids down. And then I’ll pick up Scheana and her Australian husband.”]]><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn52VmXyorculnKuxXai2tbHMmqdod6OhwqiJ0pyfnpmelnqru8qeqmaZkqTCtXnSnpquqpmpxm6t02anrqWgYr%2B2uMSsZKudpaO2sLqMmqSinF2nrrLBxKVknaqRoq4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ne-yo-wife-4717423.html><span>←</span><span>Find Out More About Crystal Renay &amp;amp; His Past Romances Hollywood Life</span></a>
