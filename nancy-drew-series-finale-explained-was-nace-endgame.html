He was half right. It is. But now I know that we choose soulmates ourselves. Fate leaves that up to us,” Nancy said in a voiceover, which was a throwback to the original format of the show. “And like he also said, maybe you get more than one. I know that I have. I got four.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Before Nancy Drew came to an end</a>, McMann, 26, teased the show’s <a href=#>final message of “hope and encouragement,”</a> exclusively telling Us Weekly in May, “[Also that] life comes with moments of great suffering, trial, loss and grief, but that there’s still good everywhere around you. It is possible to feel happiness again and to find community when you feel like you’ve lost it. I really think that the whole series is a huge message of hope that things will always get better and that there are people that will always believe you’re worth fighting for.”</p><p>Scroll down to see where every Nancy Drew character ended up in season 4:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bjrq%2Bv2Gabq52nYsCmvsieqmaemaOurbGMnq%2BppJGeu6awjLCYrGWelrCmecSnm6CZnZp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-natalia-tselikovskaya-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Natalia Tselikovskaya Dating Now</span></a>
